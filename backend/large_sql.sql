    'An <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0h61">archaeological</a> gold rhinoceros figurine from Mapungubwe in South Africa. This unique, only gold figure of a rhinoceros in the world is made of several pieces of thin <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m025rs2z">gold</a> foil, which was originally nailed onto a wooden carving. The shape was achieved by pressing gold foil over the wooden figurine and holding it in place with tiny gold nails. The wooden core has since decayed. The hollow, inner surface has a matt texture, which suggests that the gold was hammered out on a stone anvil, but is pale in comparison to the shiny exterior burnished gold surface. The body is made from a single folded sheet of gold that has been shaped by creasing and slight hammering or repoussï¿½. The head with a square muzzle is made of separate gold foil, as is the short horn, which is conically folded and shows a multitude of nail perforations. The <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m01ssh5">shoulders</a> with a prominent hump and stumpy short legs are clearly defined, as is the torso and sloping rump. The torso is centrally bulged to indicate a round belly and the broad feet are flared outward. The tail on the lower rump is positioned upright and hammered from a solid gold nugget. The tail is also decorated with incisions by a sharp tool to indicate a tuft on the tip. Two small, fluted ears are made from slightly thicker foil and were shaped separately. They are tacked to the head with two gold nails, while the eyes are formed by two solid capped gold nails.  This is the only precious <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m04t7l">metal</a> rhinoceros figurine in the world and is a unique <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0hzlz">South African</a> heritage object, declared as national heritage.  The archaeological landscape of Mapungubwe in South Africa was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2003. Fragments of the gold rhinoceros were found on the summit of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m07h3lt">Mapungubwe</a> Hill in South Africa in 1933 and in 1934 were classified as coming from the original gold grave (M1 A620). The gold has been dated to CE 1250 - CE 1290- this is the Iron Age period of southern <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0dg3n1">Africa</a> and the figurine is of a diminutive size (145.26mm x 55.06mm) weighing on 37.4g of nearly 90% carat gold.

Arum Lilies or Zantedeschia is a genus of eight species of herbaceous, perennial, flowering <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m05s2s">plants</a> in the family Araceae, native to southern <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0dg3n1">Africa</a> from South Africa north to <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m04tr1">Malawi</a>. The genus has been introduced to all the continents except Antarctica. The painting was donated by Maggie Laubser in 1931 after the first exhibition at the University of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a>''s MacFadyen Memorial Hall. Laubser was a pioneer for Expressionism and Fauvism in South Africa. Short biography: Maria Magdalena (<a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0hrf0cv">Maggie) Laubser</a> was born on the farm ï¿½Bloublommetjieskloofï¿½ in the Malmesbury district in 1886. Laubser left South Africa to travel Europe in 1913. With the outbreak of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0cm2xh">the First World War</a>, Laubser moved from <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m059j2">The Netherlands</a> to <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m04jpl">London</a> where she attended formal art classes at the Slade School of Art from 1914 to 1919.

Pierneefï¿½s fascination with trees began at an early age while exploring the outskirts of Pretoria. It was particularly the character of various tree species and how the trunks, branches and leaves contributed to the forms and shapes of the trees that fascinated the artist. He spent hours sketching every detail of a specific tree and his depictions of the South African skyscape is iconic of his oeuvre. Pierneef''s tree subjects included Baobab <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m07j7r">trees</a>, Fig Trees and Acacias such as Camel-thorn, Sweet-thorn, Fever-tree and Wild Seringa. Short biography: Jacob Hendrik (Henk) Pierneef was born in 1886 in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a>, South Africa. As a child, he studied art at school, along with other students who would later become well-known artists, such as <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0h52rv3">Fanie Eloff</a> for sculpture and Gordon Leith for architecture. In 1900, Pierneef went with his parents to <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m059j2">The Netherlands</a> as a means to avoid the hostilities of the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0bqtx">South African War</a> (1899-1902) where he studied at the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06hdk">Rotterdam</a> Art Academy.

In 1913, Pierneef had his first solo exhibition and rapidly became one of the most recognised names in South African art. In 1929 he was commissioned to create panels for the new <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0g284">Johannesburg</a> Railway station, a project which today would be seen as one of his greatest achievements. Pierneef received an honorary doctorate from the University of Pretoria in 1957 in recognition of his work, shortly after in the same year he passed away in Pretoria.',

In 1937, Van Wouw was interviewed about this self-portrait, during his interview it was related to the journalist that Van Wouw was 63 years of age when he commenced the work in 1925, but it was only completed in 1927. Van Wouw claimed that the bronze Self-portrait was intended as his headstone. After his death in 1945, according to his bequest the bronze portrait was surmounted as a headstone to his grave, but it was unfortunately stolen in 1981 and never recovered. This portrait in the possession of the University of Pretoria was cast posthumously by the Fernando Marinelli Foundry in Florence in 1976. Short biography: Anton van Wouw was born on 26 December 1862 in Driebergen in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m059j2">the Netherlands</a>.

He was trained as an illustrator and drew for journals like the Lustige Blï¿½tter and Ulk from around 1910. The First World War and the subsequent, Great Depression turned the artist to revolutionary politics and he began to produce cartoons that were often described as obscene, bitter and treasonable. Grosz was taken to court several times for deeply offending the bourgeois. After the Naziï¿½s took over the German government, Grosz began to target them, but for fear of retribution he had to flee the country where he immigrated in 1933 to <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m09c7w0">the United States</a>. Grosz returned to West Berlin in 1959 where he passed away shortly after his arrival.',

Pierneef was obsessed with trees but rarely painted from life. He said that he was never comfortable painting outdoors and would rather sketch what he saw and then paint in his studio. This work is a typical painting of Bushveld <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m07j7r">trees</a>, the title however is from the line of trees on the bank of the Elands river in Mpumalanga near Dullstroom. The University Purchased this work from the Vergeet-my-nie female residence in 1992. Short Biography: <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m043cgm">Jacob Hendrik</a> (Henk) Pierneef was born in 1886 in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a>, South Africa. As a child, he studied art at school, along with other students who would later become well-known artists, such as <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0h52rv3">Fanie Eloff</a> for sculpture and Gordon Leith for architecture. In 1900, Pierneef went with his parents to <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m059j2">The Netherlands</a> as a means to avoid the hostilities of the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0bqtx">South African War</a> (1899-1902) where he studied at the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06hdk">Rotterdam</a> Art Academy. Pierneef returned to South Africa in 1904 and studied under the prominent artists <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m09n5cb">Anton van Wouw</a>, <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0gh6wcz">Frans Oerder</a> and Hugo Naude. In 1913, Pierneef had his first solo exhibition and rapidly became one of the most recognised names in South African art. In 1929 he was commissioned to create panels for the new <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0g284">Johannesburg</a> Railway station, a project which today would be seen as one of his greatest achievements.

This is deliberate play on the Dutch idiom meaning, Als Een Haring Naar de Sloep Staren, which can be loosely translated into English as ï¿½to stare like a haring at the fishing sloopï¿½ or ï¿½to look sadï¿½. A small group of people are depicted in the bottom right corner of the painting. They appear wealthy, neatly dressed sitting alongside the muddy river and appear to fishing for pleasure. On the opposite side of the river, there is a girl in traditional Dutch dress, which is much more modest and she is fishing for survival. This Bles painting is based on the wealthy or rich aiming for a simple life and the poor, depicted by the girl wishing for a better life. The painting is part of the University of Pretoria art collection and the provenance of the work shows that the Dienst der Belastinge or, the Dutch Tax service sold the work at an Auction house known as Van Marle, de Sille &amp; Baan in Rotterdam on 28 February 1951, Lot 14. The Dutch Tax service acquired the work from the Firm, B. Katz in Dieren as compensation for outstanding tax. J A van Tilburg (1888-1980) purchased this work presumably on auction and it remained in this collection until 1957 when it was imported into <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0hzlz">South Africa</a> and he then bequeathed his vast collection in 1976 to the University of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a>.',

Piet Retief (1780-1838) was the President of the Voortrekkers (Colonial Pioneers) that moved from the current day Eastern Cape to the present day KwaZulu Natal. On 25 January 1838 he left his wagon <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m07jdr">train</a> to negotiate with the Zulu King Dingane. This panel was created to commemorate this event on the centenary in 1938 but it was too expensive to cast in bronze and the project was never completed. The damaged plaster was part of the artistsï¿½ studio contents after his death in 1945. Short biography: <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m09n5cb">Anton van Wouw</a> was born on 26 December 1862 in Driebergen in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m059j2">the Netherlands</a>.

He studied at the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06hdk">Rotterdam</a> Academy for Arts, but stopped his studies to join his father and brother in South Africa. After having a hard time as an artist in the early beginnings of his career of the then Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek (South African Republic 1852-1902) Van Wouw was finally recognised for his work when Sammy Marks (1884-1920), a Lithuanian-born South African industrialist and financier, commissioned Van Wouw to create the famous Kruger Memorial, currently situated on Church Square in the centre of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0hzlz">South Africa''s</a> Capital city Pretoria. From there, Van Wouw''s art went from strength to strength creating over 10 large bronze monuments, as well as more than 100 other sculptures in his lifetime.

Although this artwork by Tommy Motswai is a Valentine''s day celebration, it shows the pleasure Motswai finds when people gather. The artistsï¿½ works also show subtleties and humor found within the relationship and the changing political and social environment of South Africa. It is this social and multicultural environment which the artist loves to explore with his disability as a deaf artist. Motswai studied at Kutlwanong School for the Deaf near the town of Rustenburg. Motswai has since become a well-known figure in South African art as his works are widely represented in both local and international galleries.

Or Had You Forgotten forms part of Victorï¿½s most notable and ongoing ï¿½Disasters of Peaceï¿½ series, which was inspired by <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m02y23">Francisco de Goya</a>ï¿½s (1746-1828) sequence of etchings ï¿½Disasters of Warï¿½ (1810-1820). In this series of the ï¿½Disasters of Peaceï¿½, Victor addresses the aftermath of apartheid and the ongoing struggles for peace and justice in South Africa. Victor conveys powerful commentary on the effects of violence and conflict and the toll it takes on individuals and communities as portrayed through daily media coverage. Through her use of vivid imagery and bold mark making, Victor conveys the devastating impact of murder, racism, corruption, oppression, poverty and the ongoing struggle for recovery and healing. The ï¿½Disasters of Peaceï¿½ series explores brutality and grievances that are so frequent that they no longer raise outcry from the South African public. The ï¿½Disasters of Peaceï¿½  has been widely acclaimed for its unflinching honesty and its ability to confront difficult topics within the irony of daily life. Short Biography: Diane Victor is a prominent South African artist born in 1964. She is best known for her printmaking, drawing, smoke drawing, and installation works that address political and social issues. Victor received her training at the University of the Witwatersrand and has since established herself as a significant figure in the South African and international art scene.

The sculptor, better known as Fanie, was born in 1885 in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a> South Africa. In 1910 his father sent him to <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0f8l9c">France</a> to study mining ï¿½ after spending a couple of months in Paris he decided to rather study art. This had his father livid and he was cut off financially. In 1912, at the 130th Salon exhibition at the Grand Palais de Champs-Elysees in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m05qtj">Paris</a>, Fanie was the only sculptor to compete against the world-famous French sculptor, <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0wgm">Auguste Rodin</a> (1840 ï¿½ 1917). When Rodin took part in a competition all the sculptors of Paris withdrew their entries as they complained that they simply could not win against such a formidable artist. This did not deter Eloff, who was also the grandson of the Late President <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m010f4d">Paul Kruger</a> (of the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek), he entered the competition with this work titled ''The Boxer''. Eloff walked away with the prize and received much praise for this feat. Not only did he win the prize, he also sent a newspaper clipping home to his mother, who in turn showed it to his father. Eloffï¿½s Father was rather impressed and decided that the boy had artistic talent, and he reinstated his financial aid to his son. ''The Boxer'' was entered again in the 1924 Olympic Games along with another work titled, "Javelin Thrower". This was two of the only three South African <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06msq">sculptures</a> to ever compete at the Olympic Games in the mixed sculpture category. Eloff was given an honorable mention for the work (One of only three South African artworks to ever receive a prize on the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m05nd_">Olympic games</a> until art as an "Olympic sport event" was seized in 1948). In the 1930s, Fanie donated the work for a new medical section in the Library of the University of Pretoria. The person who posed as the male model of the sculpture, was George Hainaux, a young boxer in France. In later years, he would become known as Jo la Terreur or Jo the Terror. In 1934, he became the bodyguard to Alexandre Stavisky a political figure and the main antagonist in the Stavisky affair, a famous French government financial scandal. After Stavisky was caught Hainaux turned snitch. In 1939 he started working for Pierre Bonney, a French police inspector turned Gestapo officer and was executed in 1944 for collaboration.',

The work depicts a mother, holding her baby with an army vehicle driving towards the viewer and spelling out the words ï¿½NEVER AGAINï¿½ on the road which the vehicle will be driving over. This artwork is a reminder of the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0729t">Soweto</a> Student uprising on the 16th of June in 1976, where students protested for fair education in the country. As a result of many wrongs in the country due to the apartheid government in South Africa, many people were not able to get an education of value or even any education at all. <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m05g7q">Nelson Mandela</a> said: ï¿½Education is the most powerful weapon you can use to change the worldï¿½. Willie Bester explores prevalent political and social issues of South Africa in his artworks. Such topics prominently feature in Bester''s work as he was passionate about these issues due to his own experiences. Bester left school at the age of 10 to help his family financially due to the forced removal from their home under the Group Areas Act. As a struggle artist, Bester still makes use of these problems as he addresses the social and political developments in a post-apartheid South Africa within his art making. Besterï¿½s choices of subject matter also include issues of crime, greed, poverty, corruption, government accountability and other contentious subject matters that need to be voiced and documented in the new South Africa artscape. Short biography: WIllie Bester was born in 1956 in the town Montagu in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. In 1986, Bester studied art part-time at the Community Art Project in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m01yj2">Cape Town</a> and at the beginning of the1990s became a full-time artist. Bester participated in solo and group exhibitions nationally and internationally. Bester''s artworks are also represented in major collections in South Africa and internationally.

In 1900, Pierneef went with his parents to <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m059j2">The Netherlands</a> as a means to avoid the hostilities of the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0bqtx">South African War</a> (1899-1902) where he studied at the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06hdk">Rotterdam</a> Art Academy.

    'The Bird Catcher was sculpted by the Dutch born South African artist <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m09n5cb">Anton van Wouw</a> (1862-1945). Anton van Wouw created the Bird Catcher between 1880 and 1885 when he was a student. The work is one of the earliest known works by Van Wouw. The work depicts a boy catching <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m015p6">birds</a> on a forked stick. The sculpture was most probably cast in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m01brf">bronze</a> by P.Ch.Harnmeijer Kopper en Metaalgieterij in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0jcx1">Dordrecht</a> (Netherlands) between 1930 and 1932. Short biography: Anton van Wouw was born on 26 December 1862 in Driebergen in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m059j2">the Netherlands</a>. After school, Van Wouw began as a stucco worker in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m029t1">Delft</a> where he learnt the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06msq">art of sculpture</a>. He studied at the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06hdk">Rotterdam</a> Academy for Arts, but stopped his studies to join his father and brother in South Africa. After having a hard time as an artist in the early beginnings of his career of the then Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek (South African Republic 1852-1902) Van Wouw was finally recognised for his work when Sammy Marks (1884-1920),  a Lithuanian-born South African industrialist and financier, commissioned Van Wouw to create the famous Kruger Memorial, currently situated on Church Square in the centre of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0hzlz">South Africa''s</a> Capital city Pretoria. From there, Van Wouw art went from strength to strength creating over 10 large bronze monuments, as well as more than 100 other sculptures in his lifetime. Anton van Wouw passed away in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a> in 1945 just after completing his largest work, a figure of Woman and Children for the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m02cnny">Voortrekker Monument</a> in Pretoria.',

Short biography: Nicolas (Nic) Sithole was born in Piet Retief in Mpumalanga and is a renowned <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0hzlz">South African</a> ceramicist who works from his studio in Mamelodi, near <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a>. His maternal grandmother was a potter and as a child would make clay animals and let them harden in the sun. Nic admires the work of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m019rg5">Kenyan</a> born ceramic artist Magdalene Odondo. Sithole worked under the South African ceramicist, Michelle Legg, at the University of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0g284">Johannesburg</a> and taught Nic to make traditional Zulu and Venda pots. He realised that this was the method that he could use to best express his creativity. He has explored surface treatments that enhance his forms such as burnishing, terra sigillata and smoke firings. Sithole only started producing work under his own name for the first time in 2007 and has since participated in many exhibitions since then, including the Ceramics Southern Africa Regional and National exhibitions. Sithole''s <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m01x5q">ceramics</a> are popular across many South African institutions, such as the University of Pretoria,  the Association of Arts in Pretoria, the Corobrik Collection, the Pretoria Art Museum, the Nelson Mandela Museum in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06f0y3">Port Elizabeth</a> and at the William Humphreys Art Gallery in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m01tjpx">Kimberley</a> as well as various private collections locally and internationally.',

This work was carved from stacks of government forms and Papers that represent three hyenas displayed as hunting trophies mounted on a wall. The hyenas are a metaphor for gargoyles that ward of evil. The  message of this work is symbolised by utilising government Papers and the depiction of hyena gargoyles effective in protecting civic society. Ironically, the mounted works reflect also hunting trophies as hyenas are signatory predators on the African savannah and are often symbolised as wild animal of ridicule due to their wild ''laugh'', hence, why they are commonly known as laughing hyenas. Hyenas are fierce pack animals, cowardly associated with death, corruption, impurity and usually negative icons. Short biography: Wim Botha was born in  1974 in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a> and studied his BA Fine Arts at the University of Pretoria. As a student, he was often controversial in the messages he portrayed in his artworks often using stacks of bibles to create religious icons and stacks of government text as commentary. Botha uses this particular Paper medium to seclude his radical content in his sculptures, whereas the subject matter may not be deemed controversial. The use of the type of Paper to create his works are iconic of his radical commentary. Botha has won several art awards for his <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06msq">sculptures</a>, which include the Standard Bank Young Artist Award (2005) and the Helgaard Steyn Prize for sculpture (2013) he has exhibited locally and internationally in countries such as <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0345h">Germany</a>, <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m03rjj">Italy</a>, <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0f8l9c">France</a>, <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0d0vqn">Sweden</a> and <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06srk">Senegal</a>.',

Pierneef was disappointed and devastated by the building construction of the Union Buildings on Meintjieskop in Pretoria. He was of the view that the hill should be kept a natural area, undeveloped and several well-known figures in the city protested against the location of the new government building. A compromise was made by the Union Building Committee that as much of the natural landscape would be kept intact as possible during the construction. As a result, Pierneef painted a whole series of 12 works that decpited the destruction of Meintjieskop  during the construction period of the Union Buildings. To illustrate the destructive process of building upon a natural and beautiful hill, his paintings were done in grey sombre colours. The series of Pierneef was donated by his daugther to the University of Pretoria in 1980.. Short Biography: Jacob Hendrik (Henk) Pierneef was born in 1886 in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a>, South Africa. As a child, he studied art at school, along with other students who would later become well-known artists, such as <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0h52rv3">Fanie Eloff</a> for sculpture and Gordon Leith for <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m03nfmq">architecture</a>. In 1900, Pierneef went with his parents to <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m059j2">The Netherlands</a> as a means to avoid the hostilities of the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0bqtx">South African War</a> (1899-1902) where he studied at the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06hdk">Rotterdam</a> Art Academy. Pierneef returned to South Africa in 1904 and studied under the prominent artists <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m09n5cb">Anton van Wouw</a>, <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0gh6wcz">Frans Oerder</a> and Hugo Naude. In 1913, Pierneef had his first solo exhibition and rapidly became one of the most recognised names in South African art. In 1929 he was commissioned to create panels for the new <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0g284">Johannesburg</a> Railway station, a project which today would be seen as one of his greatest achievements. Pierneef received an honorary doctorate from the University of Pretoria in 1957 in recognition of his work, shortly after in the same year he passed away in Pretoria.',

Edwards is a great admirer of the late president Nelson Mandela. During the years in which Mandela was incarcerated, Edwards collected some of his banned publications. On many occasions, the artist proposed ideas to the African National Congress (ANC) for <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06msq">sculptures</a> of Mandela, even before his election as President in 1994. However, it was only in 1998, when Edwards could finally realise his sculpture of President Mandela, when the South African National Boxing Control Commission commissioned the portrait of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m05g7q">President Nelson Mandela</a> I. In this sculpture by Edwards, the words ï¿½Children Our Futureï¿½ are inscribed on the front of the work, showing the love Mandela had for children and the better future he strived to provide children with. Short Biography: Mike Edwards was born in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06f0y3">Port Elizabeth</a> South Africa in 1938.

He studied art initially at the Port Elizabeth Art School where he gained the National Art Teachers Certificate. He subsequently obtained a BA and MA in Fine Arts from the University of Pretoria. His first teaching post was in Bloemfontein where he became Head of the Art Department and Vice-Principal of the then Technical College. In 1973, he accepted a post as a lecturer at the University of Pretoria, later becoming Associate Professor of Fine Art. In 1990, he left teaching to become a full-time practicing artist. He has undertaken numerous visits overseas where has made a particular study of bronze as a medium for sculpture. These included foundries in America, the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m07ssc">United Kingdom</a>, France and <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m03rjj">Italy</a> and the facility of Hermann Noack in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0156q">Berlin</a>. Edward received many commissions, including a 20m high stainless steel sculpture in Pretoria, the Delville Wood Panel in Longueval, <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0f8l9c">France</a>, and many portraits of public figures, academics and fellow artists. He has works in public buildings in South Africa such as the SA Medical  and Dental Council, State Theatre, Civitas and Momentum Life, all in Pretoria, and some provincial buildings of the Free State. Edwards has exhibited in group shows since 1959 in South Africa, <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m09c7w0">America</a>, <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0345h">Germany</a>, and the UK.

Pierneef was upset with the construction of the Union Buildings on Meintjieskop in Pretoria. He''s view was that the hill should be kept a natural area and several well known figures in the city protested the location of the new government building. The promise made to them by the Union Building committee was that the natural landscape would be kept intact. Pierneef painted an entire series of 12 works that showed the destruction created by the construction. To illustrate this the painting was done in grey sombre colours. The series was donated to the University in 1980 by the daughter of the artist. Short Biography: Jacob Hendrik (Henk) Pierneef was born in 1886 in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a>, South Africa.

This self-portrait of Makan, after Gustav Klimt <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/g120t4114">Adele Bloch-Bauer</a> I is translucent and can be viewed from both the front and the back.  Makan is a descendant of Indian migrants who arrived in South Africa during British colonial rule. She uses the cobbler stitch, a method of stitching she inherited from her Indian Gujarati ancestors from the Mochi caste who were known cobblers in their trade. The women from the Gujarati are also celebrated for their embroidery, a <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m01mrgs">craft</a> that Makan inherited and explores within her work. Makan makes use of materials such as <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0dl6q">silk</a>, sequins, crystals, vintage saris and ribbons, which are embroidered onto shimmering <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0dnr7">fabrics</a> such as organza or other netted fabrics. Makan makes use of this craft to create personal narratives within her work, as a means to explore notions of the past and the present. She creates artworks that highlight historical and contemporary contexts within South Africa. She features themes of globalization, migration and also the deterioration of the environment are embedded within her artistic narratives. However, notions of ancient Hindu and Buddhist philosophies and scriptures are also immersed in her work, as these become lenses through which she views and narrates her environment.

Keeping Score forms part of Victorï¿½s most notable and ongoing ï¿½Disasters of Peaceï¿½ series, which was inspired by <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m02y23">Francisco de Goya</a>ï¿½s (1746-1828) sequence of etchings ï¿½Disasters of Warï¿½ (1810-1820). In this series of the ï¿½Disasters of Peaceï¿½, Victor addresses the aftermath of apartheid and the ongoing struggles for peace and justice in South Africa. Victor conveys powerful commentary on the effects of violence and conflict and the toll it takes on individuals and communities as portrayed through daily media coverage. Through her use of vivid imagery and bold mark making, Victor conveys the devastating impact of murder, racism, corruption, oppression, poverty and the ongoing struggle for recovery and healing. The ï¿½Disasters of Peaceï¿½ series explores brutality and grievances that are so frequent that they no longer raise outcry from the South African public. The ï¿½Disasters of Peaceï¿½  has been widely acclaimed for its unflinching honesty and its ability to confront difficult topics within the irony of daily life. Short Biography: Diane Victor is a prominent South African artist born in 1964.

    'District 6 was painted by the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0hzlz">South African</a> artist Gregoire Boonzaier (1909-2005). Boonzaier painted District Six hundreds of times during his lifetime and was one of the biggest voices against the Apartheids regime''s forced removal and demolishing of the historical landscape in the 1970s. This painting is interesting for two reasons, the first being Lionshead, a <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m09d_r">mountain</a> in Cape Town, in the background. The orientation of the mountain which is a landmark in the city, is wrong for the location of the building in the foreground. The second interesting part of the painting is the date 1934, as Boonzaier was in London at that stage. It is well- known that the artist, later in his life  completed and signed old Canvases he never completed for various reasons, this one most probably due to the mistake made with the mountain. Boonzaier would then from memory, often back date his paintings. This painting was donated to the University of Pretoria by the artist in 2000 for a bursary fund. The then Principal of the University acquired the painting from the bursar for the art collection. Short Biography: <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0lqfrk5">Gregoire Johannes Boonzaier</a> was born in 1909 in Newlands, Cape Town. He studied at the Heatherley School of Art in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m04jpl">London</a>. Boonzaier was a highly vocal artist about the history of the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0cn4x1">Bo-Kaap</a> and District Six in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m01yj2">Cape Town</a> and was against the Group Areas Act of the 1950s. Boonzaier is seen as the father of the Cape Impressionism, a local stylistic form related to the western Impressionism school. His artworks range from still life paintings, landscapes and portraits and he often contributed the struggle against apartheid in his subject matter prolifically as a founder of the New Group in 1938 with other South African artists such as <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0c4l7x">Walter Battiss</a>, Lippy Lipschitz, Freida Lock and Terence McCaw.

    'A digital print and enamel on canvas work of 2023 titled, Chris Hani by the South African artist Wayne Barker (b.1973) . Wayne Barker''s irreverent take on <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m043cgm">JH Pierneef</a>''s landscapes, especially his iconic Apies River scene, garnered attention in the 1980s. Barker''s pop-influenced paintings, often featuring commercial brands and rudimentary figures, challenged the traditional art establishment. Despite criticism, Barker persisted, using Pierneef''s work to comment on globalization and South Africa''s evolving identity. His later works, including collaborations with artisans, continued to blur boundaries, considering Pierneef as a pop artist and his pieces as <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0hzlz">South Africa''s</a> "first pop images." In this painting Baker uses the image of Chris Hani, the leader of the South African Communist Party and chief of staff of uMkhonto we Sizwe, the armed wing of the African National Congress who was assassinated in 1993. This artwork was acquired by means of purchase in 2023 for the University of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a> Art Collection.',

The Nude Dancer was donated to the University of Pretoria in 1960 by Mrs Rattray. Short Biography: The sculptor, better known as Fanie, was born in 1885 in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a> South Africa. In 1910 his father sent him to <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0f8l9c">France</a> to study mining ï¿½ after spending a couple of months in Paris he decided to rather study art. This had his father livid and he was cut off financially. In 1912, at the 130th Salon exhibition at the Grand Palais de Champs-Elysees in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m05qtj">Paris</a>, Fanie was the only sculptor to compete against the world-famous French sculptor, <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0wgm">Auguste Rodin</a> (1840 ï¿½ 1917). When Rodin took part in a competition all the sculptors of Paris withdrew their entries as they complained that they simply could not win against such as formidable artist. This did not deter Eloff, who was also the grandson of the Late President <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m010f4d">Paul Kruger</a> (of the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek), he entered the competition with this work titled ''The Boxer''. Eloff walked away with the prize and received much praise for this feat. Not only did he win the prize, he also sent a newspaper clipping home to his mother, who in turn showed it to his father. Eloffï¿½s Father was rather impressed and decided that the boy had artistic talent, and he reinstated his financial aid to his son. After this Eloffed moved between South Africa and France and became famous for his figures of ballet dancers and sportsmen. Eloff had to flee Paris with the advent of the Second World War (1939-1945) and permanently returned to South Africa. He dies in Pretoria in 1947 during emergency surgery.',

Manie Maritz (1876-1940) also known as Gerrit Maritz, was a Boer officer during the Second Boer War (<a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0bqtx">South African War</a>) and a leading rebel of the 1914 Maritz Rebellion that attempted to overthrow the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m07ssc">British</a> Government in South Africa.

The artist complain that the work remains incomplete, poorly finished and approval from Martiz''s widow was still pending. This portrait work was never completed and was acquired by the University of Pretoria as part of Van Wouw''s bequest in 1978. Short biography: Anton van Wouw was born on 26 December 1862 in Driebergen in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m059j2">the Netherlands</a>. After school, Van Wouw began as a stucco worker in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m029t1">Delft</a> where he learnt the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06msq">art of sculpture</a>. He studied at the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06hdk">Rotterdam</a> Academy for Arts, but stopped his studies to join his father and brother in South Africa. After having a hard time as an artist in the early beginnings of his career of the then Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek (South African Republic 1852-1902) Van Wouw was finally recognised for his work when Sammy Marks (1884-1920), a Lithuanian-born South African industrialist and financier, commissioned Van Wouw to create the famous Kruger Memorial, currently situated on Church Square in the centre of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0hzlz">South Africa''s</a> Capital city Pretoria. From there, Van Wouw art went from strength to strength creating over ten large bronze monuments, as well as more than 100 other sculptures in his lifetime. Anton van Wouw passed away in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a> in 1945 just after completing his largest work, a figure of Woman and Children for the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m02cnny">Voortrekker Monument</a> in Pretoria.',

Pierneef was disappointed and devastated by the building construction of the Union Buildings on Meintjieskop in Pretoria. He was of the view that the hill should be kept a natural area, undeveloped and several well-known figures in the city protested against the location of the new government building. A compromise was made by the Union Building Committee that as much of the natural landscape would be kept intact as possible during the construction. As a result, Pierneef painted a whole series of 12 works that decpited the destruction of Meintjieskop  during the construction period of the Union Buildings. To illustrate the destructive process of building upon a natural and beautiful hill, his paintings were done in grey sombre colours. The series of Pierneef was donated by his daugther to the University of Pretoria in 1980..

In a year where protesting were seen across the world due to the Black Lives Matter Movement, Covid-19 restrictions and food shortages, Teffo encapsulated this spirit in this small <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06msq">sculpture</a>. Short biography: Michael Madimetja Teffo was born in 1957 in the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a> township of Lady Selborne. He went to school in Hammanskraal, but abandoned school early to focus on his artwork. Teffo has received no formal institutional art training, but he was interested in art from a young age, sculpting in Marula wood with a pen knife as a child. His first solo exhibition was held at the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0hzlz">South African</a> Association of Arts in May 1978. From 1977, Teffo participated in group and solo exhibitions in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0g284">Johannesburg</a>, Pretoria and Potchefstroom in South Africa and in 1980, he exhibited pen and ink drawings at the Nassau County Black History Museum in New York.

Hendriks was <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m04ztj">married</a> to a fellow artist, Petrus Anton Hendriks and Eloff produced this work when Petrus Hendriks became Director of the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0g284">Johannesburg</a> Art Gallery in South Africa. Short Biography: The sculptor, better known as Fanie, was born in 1885 in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a> South Africa. In 1910 his father sent him to <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0f8l9c">France</a> to study mining ï¿½ after spending a couple of months in Paris he decided to rather study art. This had his father livid and he was cut off financially. In 1912, at the 130th Salon exhibition at the Grand Palais de Champs-Elysees in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m05qtj">Paris</a>, Fanie was the only sculptor to compete against the world-famous French sculptor, <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0wgm">Auguste Rodin</a> (1840 ï¿½ 1917). When Rodin took part in a competition all the sculptors of Paris withdrew their entries as they complained that they simply could not win against such as formidable artist. This did not deter Eloff, who was also the grandson of the Late President <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m010f4d">Paul Kruger</a> (of the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek), he entered the competition with this work titled ''The Boxer''. Eloff walked away with the prize and received much praise for this feat. Not only did he win the prize, he also sent a newspaper clipping home to his mother, who in turn showed it to his father. Eloffï¿½s Father was rather impressed and decided that the boy had artistic talent, and he reinstated his financial aid to his son. After this Eloffed moved between South Africa and France and became famous for his figures of ballet dancers and sportsmen. Eloff had to flee Paris with the advent of the Second World War (1939-1945) and permanently returned to South Africa. He dies in Pretoria in 1947 during emergency surgery.',

Mandela was <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0hzlz">South Africaï¿½s</a> first black head of the state and the first president to be elected in a fully representative democratic election. Mandela was also a South African anti-apartheid revolutionary hero, a political leader and a philanthropist, who served as the President of South Africa from 1994 until 1999. Mandela, an icon of democracy and social justice, received many awards and honours, including a Nobel Peace Prize for his dedication to make South Africa and the world a better more peaceful place.

In 1993, he created a stoneware <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m01x5q">ceramic</a> fountain, known as The Peace Fountain, which was bought by the Felix Trust and donated to the University of Pretoria. Nel erected the fountain next to the Musaion Building (houses the Department of Music and Music Library) on the main Hatfield Campus. The fountain in its totality is created from ceramic materials. However, the work as seen currently is not the original fountain. In 2001 a student damaged the original fountain by trying to climb onto it. The original structure of the fountain was damaged to the degree that it had to be replaced. Nevertheless, the work is made up of four ceramic blocks at the bottom, forming a cross shape. The cross symbolises that Africa came to a crossroad. The first block on top of the cross is a grinding stone, which shows <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0dg3n1">Africaï¿½s</a> early development. It is then topped with another grinding stone, but one with a hole right through. The second grinding stone represents the impact of colonialism. The third level is a broken grinding stone, that is inverted back to back and indicates the technological advancement of Africa. At the very top, an egg is depicted in ceramic as a sign of new life with water flowing out of it, signifying living water. Short Biography: Thijs Nel was born on the farm Waterkloof near <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a> on 8 June 1943. During his career as an artist, he achieved considerable renown as a potter and ceramicist.

The title is derived from the star named Betelgeuse or Alpha Orionis and it is also a hermetic character from the brightest star in the constellation known as Orion''s Belt. The astronaut is surrounded by astral bodies like Epsilon Boï¿½tis (a two star system) and Phobos (A moon of Mars). At the bottom of the painting are the words, "wird mir aller Lohn zu Theil" translated as ï¿½I will pay for part of allï¿½.  Short biography. The Johannesburg born artist, Christo Coetzee pursued his art studies at the Slade School of Art in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m04jpl">London</a> as a complementary tuition exercise to his fine art degree qualification acquired from the University of the Witwatersrand in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0g284">Johannesburg</a> South Africa. Most of Coetzee''s works are mainly colourful, stylized figurative images and still lifes. After completing his studies he moved to Europe on an Government Travelling Scholarship  and become part of the Stadler Stable in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m05qtj">Paris</a> before moving to Finestrat in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06mkj">Spain</a>.

It was in Japan that Coetzee developed his later art style that ultimately classified him as <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0hzlz">South Africa''s</a> leading and prominent avant-garde artists. Coetzee received international recognition for his contribution to the avant-garde art movements known as Art Informel, Assemblage and Neo-Baroque in Paris, Spain and Japan during the 1950s and 1960s, an art style he perfected.

Pierneef was upset with the construction of the Union Buildings on Meintjieskop in Pretoria. He''s view was that the hill should be kept a natural area and several well-known figures in the city protested the location of the new government building. The promise made to them by the Union Building committee is that the natural landscape would be kept intact. Pierneef created an entire series of 12 works that showed the destruction created by the construction. To illustrate this the drawing was done in grey somber colors. The series was donated to the University in 1980 by the daughter of the artist.

The simplification of human figures into a decorative pattern, depicting a mother and child, typified her work of the mid-1950s period. The process of pictorial simplification is strengthened by the use of dark contour lines and interlocking planes. Flat colour planes are articulated in such a manner that the surface becomes a decorative abstracted representation.The painting was donated by the artist in 1988 after a retrospective exhibition held at the University of Pretoria where she later in the same year donated a further 58 works to the University of Pretoria. Short Biography: Bettie Cilliers-Barnard was born Elizabeth Petronella (Bettie) Barnard on 18 November 1914 in the town of Rustenburg, South Africa. She completed her BA-degree at the University of Pretoria in 1937. In 1938 she began her career as an art teacher at the Innesdale Intermediary School. From 1939, she lectured in art at the Normal College in Pretoria for three years. On 19 December 1942, she <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m04ztj">married</a> a teacher, Mr. Carl Hanke (Bags) Cilliers and then became Bettie Cilliers-Barnard. Shortly afterwards her husband was appointed as an Extramural Officer at the University of Pretoria. From this time forward, a very close relationship developed between the Cilliers family and the University of Pretoria. In 1946, Cilliers-Barnard held her first solo-exhibition at the old Extramural building at the University of Pretoria in Vermeulen Street, <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a>. In 1948, she travelled to <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0154j">Belgium</a> and France to study further at the Koninklijke Academie voor Schone Kunsten and Hogere Instituten in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0fydw">Antwerp</a> under Professor Julian Creytens and at the Atelier <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0clw1p">Andrï¿½ Lï¿½Hï¿½te</a> in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m05qtj">Paris</a>.

This work was carved from stacks of government forms and papers that represent three Wildebeest''s often displayed as hunting trophies mounted on a wall. The common name "blue wildebeest" refers to the conspicuous, silvery-blue sheen of the antelopes <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m01xygc">coat</a>.  The Wildebeest is a common broad shouldered and horned antelope found in East and southern <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0dg3n1">Africa</a>. Short biography: Wim Botha was born in  1974 in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a> and studied his BA Fine Arts at the University of Pretoria. As a student, he was often controversial in the messages he portrayed in his artworks often using stacks of bibles to create religious icons and stacks of government text as commentary. Botha uses this particular paper medium to seclude his radical content in his sculptures, whereas the subject matter may not be deemed controversial. The use of the type of paper to create his works are iconic of his radical commentary. Botha has won several art awards for his <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06msq">sculptures</a>, which include the Standard Bank Young Artist Award (2005) and the Helgaard Steyn Prize for sculpture (2013) he has exhibited locally and internationally in countries such as <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0345h">Germany</a>, <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m03rjj">Italy</a>, <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0f8l9c">France</a>, <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0d0vqn">Sweden</a> and <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06srk">Senegal</a>.

Doyle is an internationally-recognised sculptor from South Africa whose trademark of the fuller female-figure offers interesting social critiques and is a tool on social commentary of women in society. Her bronze works often reflect the Spirit of Women bronze sculptures, African images of women, some miniature <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m01brf">bronzes</a> and lifesize bronze sculptures.

The sculpture was commissioned to Van Wouw by the former Bechuanaland government, today  known as <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0166v">Botswana</a> for their government buildings shortly after the death of this famous king of the BaNgwato people. This <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m01brf">bronze</a> was cast by the Renzo Vignali Artistic Foundry in February 1984. Short biography: <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m09n5cb">Anton van Wouw</a> was born on 26 December 1862 in Driebergen in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m059j2">the Netherlands</a>.

He also started to study at the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06hdk">Rotterdam</a> Academy for Arts but stopped his studies to join his father and brother in South Africa. After having a hard time as an artist in the early beginnings of his career of the then Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek (South African Republic), Van Wouw finally got his big break when Sammy Marks, a rich industrialist, commissioned Van Wouw to create the famous Kruger Memorial, currently situated on Church Square in the centre of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0hzlz">South Africa''s</a> Capital city Pretoria. From there, Van Wouw went from creating over 10 large monuments, as well as more than 100 other <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06msq">sculptures</a> in his lifetime. Anton van Wouw passed away in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a> in 1945 just after completing his largest work, a figure of Woman and Children for the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m02cnny">Voortrekker Monument</a>.',

Professor Martin Lourens du Toit (1897-1938) served as a patron of South African visual art in the 1930s and the first Head of the Department of Afrikaans. He initiated a series of more than 25 art exhibitions in the MacFadyen Memorial Hall from 1931 to 1939, to display the work of South African artists, often contentious artists. The University of Pretoria supported the artists and provided the exhibition space free of charge at the time. As a token of appreciation, many artists donated their artwork at the end of each exhibition. Du Toit used these exhibitions as a starting point in building up a representative collection of South African art, which he augmented with donations from other artists and art collectors. Several artists such as Irma Stern, <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0hrf0cv">Maggie Laubser</a>, <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0lqfrk5">Gregoire Boonzaier</a>, Alexis Preller and many 20th century, (now iconic) <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0hzlz">South Africa''s</a> most significant artists exhibited at the MacFadyen Memorial Hall, after which they donated their works to the University of Pretoria.

Van Wouw called the work Andorobo, which was a hunter gatherer group that lived in modern day <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m07tp2">Ugande</a>.

The painting depicts a period when the Old Arts Building was enveloped invasively by green ivy. The ivy covering the building was the so-called, ï¿½<a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m01cx_">Boston</a> Ivyï¿½, native to the East Coast of the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m09c7w0">United States</a>, hence the source of the phrase an "Ivy-League University". In 1991, the ivy was completely removed from the building by the company Holm, Jordan &amp; Holm due to the large-scale damage it was doing to the historic sandstone. The rain clouds are depicted to create dark shadows from the tree on the left entering the picture plane and draw the shadows towards the beginnings of a garden and small water feature. Parts of the lawn are green with some <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0c9ph5">flowers</a> in bloom suggesting spring. The walls of the building are painted greyish instead of the typical orange-type colour of sandstone. Thus, the Old Arts Building appears heavy, quiet, and empty with bare sand as a courtyard, suggesting no personal or people interacting with the landscape space, there is a portion of a palm <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m07j7r">tree</a> on the right. Short Biography:  William George Graham Bevington was born in 1881, in Seymour in the Eastern Cape. He studied at the Rhodes University in Grahamstown from 1903. In 1906, he was awarded the Rhodes Bursary to study at the Kensington Royal College of Art in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m04jpl">London</a>. Bevington was deaf, mute and held several teaching positions and was the illustrative cartoonist for the newspaper, Cape Times. Not much is known about his later life, he passed away on 4 October 1953 in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m01yj2">Cape Town</a>.',

The work is part of a series purchased by the University of Pretoria in 2007. The series comments on the artist''s spiritual journey through the transmutation ceremonies of the San people, Christianity as well as his personal journey through living in the veld to being integrated to modern society. Short Biography: Vetkat Kruiper Regopstaan Boesman (mostly referred to as Vetkat Kruiper) was born in 1969 in Twee Rivieren and was a member of the Khomani San tribe in what is today known as the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park region. His father was a healer and crafter in his community, and clearly had a huge impact on Vetkatï¿½s art knowledge and understanding of San culture and customs. vetkat is one of very few San artists who sustained the ï¿½lostï¿½ (according to some) tradition of San rock art, but with ink on <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0641k">paper</a> as medium. The animality, spirituality and symbolism in Vetkatï¿½s works has been the topic of several academic studies. Vetkatï¿½s works are in private collections at the Natal Museum Services, the McGregor Museum at <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m01tjpx">Kimberley</a> and at the University of Pretoria. From 2002 to 2005, his art was displayed at the United Nations (UN) as part of an exhibition of indigenous art, while his 2004 tour of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m09c7w0">the United States of America</a> culminated in his addressing the UN. Shortly before his death in 2007, Vetkat was invited by the Department of Built Environment at the University of Pretoria to do a solo exhibition on the University of Pretoria campus. All the works on exhibit were purchased by the University of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a>, and constitutes the largest assemblage of the artistï¿½s works in a single collection, now curated by the University of Pretoria Museums.',

Pierneef was upset with the construction of the Union Buildings on Meintjieskop in Pretoria. He''s view was that the hill should be kept a natural area and several well-known figures in the city protested the location of the new government building. The promise made to them by the Union Building committee is that the natural landscape would be kept intact. Pierneef created an entire series of 12 works that showed the destruction created by the construction. To illustrate this the drawing was done in grey somber colors. The series was donated to the University in 1980 by the daughter of the artist. Short Biography: <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m043cgm">Jacob Hendrik</a> (Henk) Pierneef was born in 1886 in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a>, South Africa.

In 1929 he was commissioned to create panels for the new <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0g284">Johannesburg</a> Railway station, a project which today would be seen as one of his greatest achievements.

The sculpture is of an unnamed black figure kneeling down to smoke dagga from a hole in the ground. The name dagga is derived from the San word dacha, a name which was in common use in the earlier years of the European settlement at the Cape. Smoking of dagga was widely used as an alternative tobacco which was expensive. Van Wouw created the work as part of his 1907 series, works intended for the Anton van Wouw Syndicate, a group of ''art lovers'' who paid him to create 10 selected works of his choice. The sculpture was cast in bronze in 1976 in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m031y2">Florence</a>, <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m03rjj">Italy</a>, at the Fonderia Ferdinando Marinelli.  Short biography: Anton van Wouw was born on 26 December 1862 in Driebergen in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m059j2">the Netherlands</a>. After school, Van Wouw began as a stucco worker in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m029t1">Delft</a> where he learnt the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06msq">art of sculpture</a>. He studied at the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06hdk">Rotterdam</a> Academy for Arts, but stopped his studies to join his father and brother in South Africa. After having a hard time as an artist in the early beginnings of his career of the then Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek (South African Republic 1852-1902) Van Wouw was finally recognised for his work when Sammy Marks (1884-1920),  a Lithuanian-born South African industrialist and financier, commissioned Van Wouw to create the famous Kruger Memorial, currently situated on Church Square in the centre of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0hzlz">South Africa''s</a> Capital city Pretoria. From there, Van Wouw''s art went from strength to strength creating over 10 large bronze monuments, as well as more than 100 other sculptures in his lifetime. Anton van Wouw passed away in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a> in 1945 just after completing his largest work, a figure of Woman and Children for the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m02cnny">Voortrekker Monument</a> in Pretoria.',

Being a bench for students, it was imperative that young artists were involved in the creation, hence two assistant artists being mentored throughout the process. Olivier involved a diverse group of student artists, giving them the opportunity to be mentored and to develop their skills.

Mr JA van Tilburg purchased the entire estate. On 28 July 1945, Gerard van Twist declared that Van Tilburg bought the estate of Louis Apol.

Not many of these works still exist, as he reworked most of these again in the late 1970s. In the case of the Bride, Christo reworked this work on Perspex, which he attached to the front of the painting. The piece of Perspex was completed in 1979. Short biography: The <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0g284">Johannesburg</a> born artist, Christo Coetzee (1929-2000) pursued his art studies at the Slade School of Art in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m04jpl">London</a>, as a complementary tuition exercise to his fine art degree qualification acquired from the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa. At the time most of his artworks of art were mainly stylized figurative images and the subject of still lifes. After that, he relocated to Europe on a government travelling scholarship becoming part of the Stadler Stable in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m05qtj">Paris</a>, <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0f8l9c">France</a> before moving to Finestrat in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06mkj">Spain</a>. Later, Coetzee visited <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m03_3d">Japan</a> where he was invited to join the Gutai Group, the first radical art group in post-war Japan. Coetzee adapted and developed his later art style, which ultimately classified him as <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0hzlz">South Africa''s</a> leading and most prominent avant-garde artist. Coetzee received international recognition for his contributions to the avant-garde art movement known as Art Informel, Assemblage and Neo-Baroque in Paris, Spain and Japan during the 1950s and 1960s. Coetzee hoped to perfect this art style. The Christo Coetzee collection in its entirety was bequeathed to the University of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a> as he passed away at the age of 71 in 2000 in the small town of Tulbagh in the Cape, South Africa.',

    'A painting by the Dutch artist Nicolaes Corneliszoon (Claes) Moeyaert (1592-1655) of the Flight to <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m02k54">Egypt</a>. In a catalogue of the works of Moeyaert in 1974, Astrid Tï¿½mpel described the painting. The painting itself depicts the flight to Egypt with Maria, Joseph and the baby Jesus being protected by angels. Interesting to note is the Italian style buildings of Pompeii in the scene as well as the volcano Vesuvius that is erupting. What is so interesting about that of course is that the flight to Egypt from <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m03spz">Israel</a> would probably not pass through <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06c62">Rome</a>. As Moeyaert spent limited time in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m03rjj">Italy</a> the eruption of the volcano is quite telling as he was traveling Italy in 1631 when the volcano was active, giving a very accurate dating to the work.

He''s view was that the hill should be kept a natural area and several well-known figures in the city protested the location of the new government building. The promise made to them by the Union Building committee is that the natural landscape would be kept intact.

In 1913, Pierneef had his first solo exhibition and rapidly became one of the most recognised names in South African art. In 1929 he was commissioned to create panels for the new <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0g284">Johannesburg</a> Railway station, a project which today would be seen as one of his greatest achievements. Pierneef received an honorary doctorate from the University of Pretoria in 1957 in recognition of his work, shortly after in the same year he passed away in Pretoria.',

    'A painting dated to 1853 by the Dutch artist Joseph Bles (1825-1875) titled A view of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0m39d">Schiedam</a>.  The Zweth is one of the windmills on the Schiedam,  these are some of the largest windmills in the world located near <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06hdk">Rotterdam</a> in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m059j2">The Netherlands</a>. The figures in the painting were called "staffage", the German word meaning decoration. Some critics claim that the figures are not the central theme of the painting, but merely human forms that have been painted to fill the landscape.  The painting depicts two <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m019jd">boats</a> on the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06cnp">river</a>, one a barge transporting food down the river by people who have to sell the food for a living. The other boat shows a group of people using the boat for leisure purposes. To amplify this disparity, the artist added a sewage pipe flowing into the exact same river. The painting is part of the University of Pretoria art collection and the provenance of the work shows that the Dienst der Belastinge or, the Dutch Tax service sold the work at an Auction house known as Van Marle, de Sille &amp; Baan in Rotterdam on 28 February 1951, Lot 14. The Dutch Tax service acquired the work from the Firm, B. Katz in Dieren as compensation for outstanding tax. J A van Tilburg (1888-1980) purchased this work presumably on auction and it remained in this collection until 1957 when it was imported into <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0hzlz">South Africa</a> and he then bequeathed his vast collection in 1976 to the University of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a>.',

The work forms part of a <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m068jd">photographic</a> series by the artist, titled: ï¿½We Didn''t Choose to be Born Hereï¿½. The series explores Makepeï¿½s family history, including themes such as exile and activism. Each portrait focuses on an individual, while the landscapes bring to light themes of sacrifice and love. Makepe uses his familyï¿½s personal archives, as well as public archives, to make a study into the lives of different family members during times of separation and crises. Robben Island University places special focus on his familyï¿½s experiences in the prison on the Island. The work depicts the limestone quarry on the island, where inmates gathered and traded knowledge. This transfer of knowledge should be considered against the historical background of the denying and restriction of education for people of colour by the Apartheid government, and therefore makes it a vital tale in the complete history of education in South Africa. The artist further illustrates the value of inter-generational value that stretches beyond the simple relaying of information. This artwork was acquired by means of purchase in 2023 for the University of Pretoria Art Collection.',

Brief biography: Sello Lucas Malemane was born in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m02jy6b">Nelspruit</a>, today the capital of the Mpumalanga Province in 1949 in South Africa. After moving around extensively as a boy, his family settled in Pretoria North. Until 1980, at least, Malemane received no formal institutional training as an artist but worked as a messenger in the Library of the University of South Africa (UNISA) in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a>. He learnt art through reading books and met his fellow artists through reading the book, Contemporary <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0dg3n1">African</a> Art in South Africa (1971) by EJ de Jager and as a result Malemane began experimenting with woodcuts. In the late 1970s, he was moved to the Department of Fine Arts where he was further inspired by the Rorkeï¿½s Drift Art School  in Natal considered one of the most prolific art schools for black artists during Apartheid. Malemaneï¿½s work is about the immortalisation of tribal traditions, something he realized would soon disappear in a modern society. This Malemane''s etchings were donated to the University of Pretoria by Carla Wasserthal. The collection belonged to her husband, Klaus Wasserthal (1927-2012) who collected African arts during the many exhibitions he held at his candle-making gallery in Pretoria. Wasserthal was known for his significant role he played at the Rorke''s Drift tapestry project which has since gained international recognition.',

These matches pitted two wild bears chained to a post to fight to the death against each other. The spectators would drink honey beer as it would get the bears upset with the smell of honey and making the fights more ferocious.

This Invasion force will later be named the Glorious Revolution. Abraham Storck was a well known Marine painter during the time and created this painting of one of the most unworthy sea battles of his time as there was none. The invading force made up of hired soldiers reached the mainland without any opposition of the English fleet. Interesting to note is the galley in the front, a very unusual ship for navigating in rough north western <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06npx">seas</a> of Europe. The galley symbolises the mercenary troops from Mediterranean countries that William brought with him to <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m02jx1">England</a>. The locality of this scene was confirmed by the square lighthouse on the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m09d_r">mountain</a>, which one stood at the entrance of the Torbay Harbour.

Vetkatï¿½s works are in private collections at the Natal Museum Services, the McGregor Museum at <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m01tjpx">Kimberley</a> and at the University of Pretoria. From 2002 to 2005, his art was displayed at the United Nations (UN) as part of an exhibition of indigenous art, while his 2004 tour of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m09c7w0">the United States of America</a> culminated in his addressing the UN. Shortly before his death in 2007, Vetkat was invited by the Department of Built Environment at the University of Pretoria to do a solo exhibition on the University of Pretoria campus. All the works on exhibit were purchased by the University of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a>, and constitutes the largest assemblage of the artistï¿½s works in a single collection, now curated by the University of Pretoria Museums.',

    'Willem Boshoff',
    '1997/1998',
    'A mixed media work (1997-1998) titled, Tree of Knowledge: Broken Garden by the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0hzlz">South African</a> sculptor Willem Boshoff (b.1951). In his artist''s statement Boshoff provides the following description to this work. "The Tree of Knowledge series commemorates the tree in its sacrificial form -- the book. It also anticipates the end of the book (if that were possible). Although the computer makes its own demands on the natural environment, in the Tree of Knowledge series I follow a serious, albeit wishful, <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m07jdr">train</a> of thought -- that there will come a time when the computer, with its built-in calculus or silicone chip, could release us from our dependency on the book as our instrument of computation and storage of information. Before the invention of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0641k">paper</a>, knowledge was managed and recorded by various means. Druids and seers made use of prehistoric ''stationery'' such as bones, wrinkles, stars and, more particularly, stones, to muse on facts and figures. The world''s oldest ''computer'' is arguably the psephos of the Greeks or the calculus of the Romans, the pebble, which was an instrument of thought and reckoning. In Druid''s keyboard I emphasise the change-over from the ''age of the pebble'' to the ''age of paper". The 36 individual pebbles made from 36 species of wood represent paper''s dependency on wood, and the 26 letters and ten numerals  are used in the common western alphabet and in most counting systems. The druids reflected on large stone <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m09l0j_">rings</a>, or smaller objects arranged in circles, showing regard for cyclical change as observed in the sun, planets and seasons. Their world was round and in motion, a world-view in sharp contrast to the flat and square one we obtain from the compressed, four-sided pages of books. Computers are still in their infancy, but at present they seem more likely to contribute to the excessive consumption of paper than to reduce it. This puts our ecological environment under severe pressure, as forests are destroyed to supply the ever-growing demand for a writing surface. Books are some of the most desirable objects on earth: yet few people realise that what libraries contain is innumerable <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m07j7r">trees</a>, broken and battered beyond recognition. <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0crnb5">Piet Mondrian</a> paid homage to the tree in a series of well-known paintings. He contemplated the transformation of the tree from its existence as natural wonder to its role as universal agency, signifying an essentially vertical and horizontal equilibrium. Letters to God also refers to the alliance of the tree to the book as creating a bridge or ladder, which we mount to reach ultimate knowledge or perfection. But, unlike Mondrian''s painting, this work is also mindful of the terrible cost of appropriating real trees for making books. The base of the work uses block-like quaternaries similar to Mondrian''s to convey the tree''s own architecture. To make paper, we bludgeon the tree into dispirited splinters and slivers. Then we reconstitute these deconstructed, shattered pieces of wood into paper to fulfil the ''noble'' role of bearer of information. The top section of Letters to God spreads out into the fibrous structure of paper as seen under a microscope. Its ''branches'' are literally bits of tree, re-made into the perverted image of yet another tree-- the Tree of Knowledge, represented by paper and the book. The ''letters'' in  Letters to God are those of the Greek alphabet, hidden within the metaphorical branches, so that, should we attempt to pick them, as Eve did, we violate the tree. The title Tree of Knowledge derives from the book of Genesis: ''... from the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat''. The ''tree'' is taken as all the paper and books of the world, and its ''fruit'' is the text and ultimately the ideas that can be harvested from it. Broken Garden is a re-enactment of the crucifixion in which the ''Word of God'' is nailed to the ''tree'' -- Christ nailed to a <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m083vt">wooden</a> cross. The spiky splinters of the work are meant to reinforce the idea that knowledge in an alphabetic, book-dependent society comes at a great cost to the universal tree, and that such knowledge causes pain, both to our natural resources and ultimately, as the sole repository of learning, to us. The wood of the work is real timber, battered into splintered pieces with a four-pound hammer to simulate the crucifixion. Broken Garden is divided into 36 wooded sections (the 26 letters of the alphabet plus the ten numerals). Splinters of dark hardwood provide the dividing lines in a configuration of four noughts-and-crosses patterns. The cross in the centre, formed by the torn paper, is a crossroad or carfax, a forking into four, signifying the place where the four major academic disciplines meet. The work belongs to the South32 collection on courtesy temporary loan to the University of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a>. Short bio: <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m026v228">Willem Boshoff</a>  was born in 1951 . He is a master carpenter but works in a variety of media, including <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06msq">sculpture</a>, installation, performance, and printmaking. After deciding to become a sculptor at the age of 15, but then training to become a teacher, he only began exhibiting his artwork publicly at the age of 30, when he had his first exhibition at the Johannesburg Art Gallery in 1981. Since becoming a full-time practising artist in 1996, Boshoffï¿½s major works include Kyk Afrikaans (1980), an anthology of concrete poetry, the Blind Alphabet Project (1995), Writing in the Sand (2001) and Garden of Words (a project in progress since 1982). His work has been shown extensively in South Africa and internationally, including at the two <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0g284">Johannesburg</a> Biennales, the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m022pfm">Sï¿½o Paulo</a>, Venice, and Havana Biennales, the Museum of African Art at the Smithsonian in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0rh6k">Washington, DC</a>, the White Box Gallery in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m02_286">New York City</a>, and Art Unlimited at the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m01k4f">Basel</a> Art Fair. The recipient of numerous awards and grants, Boshoff retains strong ties with many academic institutions as a lecturer and examiner and was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Johannesburg in 2008.',

During the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0bqtx">South African War</a> (1899-1902) Oerder was paid by the Transvaal Government to paint scenes from the war. He was captured early on and stayed in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a> where he painted the everyday life of the British in the capital. This is one of the drawings created by him during the war. In the background Lombaards Hill can be seen which dates this drawing late October, early November of 1899. Although Oerder was paid to paint the battle scenes, he was much more interested in painting the everyday life of the Boer Forces. Here he drew a small Boer encampment close to the siege that was laid at <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m02mtg_">Ladysmith</a> in KwaZulu Natal. Short Biography: Frans Oerder was born in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06hdk">Rotterdam</a> in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m059j2">the Netherlands</a> came to South Africa in 1890. He was mostly known for painting landscapes, still-life and portraits. After the South African War Oerder returned to The Netherlands in 1908 where he settled and <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m04ztj">married</a> fellow painter Gerda Pitlo in 1910. In 1938 with a second war looming in Europe, Oerder returned to South Africa where he passed away in 1944.',

After school, Van Wouw began as a stucco worker in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m029t1">Delft</a> where he learnt the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06msq">art of sculpture</a>. He studied at the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06hdk">Rotterdam</a> Academy for Arts, but stopped his studies to join his father and brother in South Africa. After having a hard time as an artist in the early beginnings of his career of the then Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek (South African Republic 1852-1902) Van Wouw was finally recognised for his work when Sammy Marks (1884-1920), a Lithuanian-born South African industrialist and financier, commissioned Van Wouw to create the famous Kruger Memorial, currently situated on Church Square in the centre of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0hzlz">South Africa''s</a> Capital city <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a>. From there, Van Wouw''s art went from strength to strength creating over ten large bronze monuments, as well as more than 100 other sculptures in his lifetime. Anton van Wouw passed away in Pretoria in 1945 and the University of Pretoria has one of the largest collections by this iconic artist, often referred to as the Father of South African sculpture.',

During the 1970s several other <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0hzlz">South African</a> sculptors including, Lucas Sithole and Sidney Kumalo created <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06msq">sculptures</a> of bulls which always included some form of pain. This cultural and social symbolism was derived from the mine workers depicted by the bull carrying the pain of the nation. Short biography: Stanley Nkosi, also called Mfoza by his peers, was born in Newcastle in Kwa-Zulu Natal during 1945. In 1973, Nkosi worked at the Artlight Factory decorating lamp bases and by chance met Linda Goodman from the Goodman Gallery. Goodman helped him to get into an art school ran by Peter Haden at the time. After some of his works were exhibited in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m04jpl">London</a> in 1974 and two were purchased by the British Prime Minister <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0kxkv">Harold Macmillan</a>, Nkosi studied at the London Art School for a couple of months.

Back in South Africa, his art expanded by being one of the key founders of the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m05rlh1">Katlehong</a> Art Society and he opened his own art gallery in 1982. Sadly in 1988, Nkosi was stabbed to death near his house in Katlehong, by that time he was a successful artist and businessman, even owning his own shopping centre.

Harlequins, Homage to Guernica is a painting of five clown-like figures and a friendly looking hellhound (a supernatural black dog from folklore) that appears to dance across this large Canvas painting. The work pays homage to the  vast painting Guernica (1937) by the Spanish artist, <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m060_7">Pablo Picasso</a> which was created in the wake of the 1937 fascist bombing of the town Guernica. This work became a defining image of the horror and atrocities of war. Coetzee saw Picasso''s work in 1961 with his exhibition at the Modern Museum of Art in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m02_286">New York</a>. Inspired by Picasso, Coetzee painted this as homage when the work was returned to Spain in 1981. Harlequins was only completed in 1987 after which he donated it to the University of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a> due to the large size of it.  Short biography. The Johannesburg born artist, Christo Coetzee pursued his art studies at the Slade School of Art in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m04jpl">London</a> as a complementary tuition exercise to his fine art degree qualification acquired from the University of the Witwatersrand in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0g284">Johannesburg</a> South Africa. Most of Coetzee''s works are mainly colourful, stylized figurative images and still lifes. After completing his studies he moved to Europe on a Government Travelling Scholarship  and become part of the Stadler Stable in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m05qtj">Paris</a> before moving to Finestrat in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06mkj">Spain</a>. Later, Coetzee went to <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m03_3d">Japan</a> where he was invited to join the Gutai Group, the first radical Art Group in post-war Japan. It was in Japan that Coetzee developed his later art style that ultimately classified him as <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0hzlz">South Africa''s</a> leading and prominent avant-garde artists. Coetzee received international recognition for his contribution to the avant-garde art movements known as Art Informel, Assemblage and Neo-Baroque in Paris, Spain and Japan during the 1950s and 1960s, an art style he perfected. He passed away at the age of 71 in 2000 in Tulbagh in the Cape and bequeathed his entire home and collection to the University of Pretoria.',

Kom Vrou En Bring Die Kinders forms part of Victorï¿½s most notable and ongoing ï¿½Disasters of Peaceï¿½ series, which was inspired by <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m02y23">Francisco de Goya</a>ï¿½s (1746-1828) sequence of etchings ï¿½Disasters of Warï¿½ (1810-1820). In this series of the ï¿½Disasters of Peaceï¿½, Victor addresses the aftermath of apartheid and the ongoing struggles for peace and justice in South Africa. Victor conveys powerful commentary on the effects of violence and conflict and the toll it takes on individuals and communities as portrayed through daily media coverage. Through her use of vivid imagery and bold mark making, Victor conveys the devastating impact of murder, racism, corruption, oppression, poverty and the ongoing struggle for recovery and healing. The ï¿½Disasters of Peaceï¿½ series explores brutality and grievances that are so frequent that they no longer raise outcry from the South African public. The ï¿½Disasters of Peaceï¿½  has been widely acclaimed for its unflinching honesty and its ability to confront difficult topics within the irony of daily life. Short Biography: Diane Victor is a prominent South African artist born in 1964. She is best known for her printmaking, drawing, smoke drawing, and installation works that address political and social issues. Victor received her training at the University of the Witwatersrand and has since established herself as a significant figure in the South African and international art scene. Her works have been widely exhibited both locally and internationally and are held in major public and private collections. She won the SASOL New Signatures Award in 1987 and became the youngest recipient of the Volkskas Atelier Award in 1988. In addition to her artistic practice, Victor has also been involved with the University of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a> as a lecturer and visiting artist.',

This type of affectionate coercion is an inherent aspect of the aggression present in all socialization. It involves a process of conformity where adhering to societal norms is dangerously similar to conforming to those in power, which had catastrophic consequences during the apartheid era in South Africa.

The work was cast twice in bronze by the Renzo Vignali Artistic Foundry in Pretoria North, one of these casts was sent to London and the other was retained by Sir Herbert Baker. The University of Pretoria acquired the small sculpture from Baker family.  Short biography: Anton van Wouw was born on 26 December 1862 in Driebergen in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m059j2">the Netherlands</a>. After school, Van Wouw began as a stucco worker in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m029t1">Delft</a> where he learnt the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06msq">art of sculpture</a>. He studied at the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06hdk">Rotterdam</a> Academy for Arts, but stopped his studies to join his father and brother in South Africa. After having a hard time as an artist in the early beginnings of his career of the then Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek (South African Republic 1852-1902) Van Wouw was finally recognised for his work when Sammy Marks (1884-1920), a Lithuanian-born South African industrialist and financier, commissioned Van Wouw to create the famous Kruger Memorial, currently situated on Church Square in the centre of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0hzlz">South Africa''s</a> Capital city, Pretoria. From there, Van Wouw art went from strength to strength creating over ten large bronze monuments, as well as more than 100 other sculptures in his lifetime. Anton van Wouw passed away in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a> in 1945 just after completing his largest work, a figure of Woman and Children for the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m02cnny">Voortrekker Monument</a> in Pretoria.',

The Fingo or Mfengu is a Xhosa speaking group living near Fort Beaufort in the Eastern Cape Province of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0hzlz">South Africa</a>, they are descendants of Kwa-Zulu natal refugees from the Mfecane period who fled in the 19 century from Zululand and moved to the south settling in the Transkei and Ciskei regions,  today part of Eastern Cape.  In his journal on 20 March 1848, the artist Thomas Baines writes about his visit to the Fingo village as depicted from experience in this painting. Short Biography: <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m08brqz">Thomas Baines (1820-1875</a>) was a British artist, naturalist, and explorer of both southern Africa and Australia. He was born in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0pfhn">Kingï¿½s Lynn</a>, Norfolk, <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m02jx1">England</a> in 1820. As a teenager, he was apprenticed to a coach painter who focused on ornamental painting and coats of arms. At the age of 22, Baines left England for South Africa and settled in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m01yj2">Cape Town</a>, where he became a portraitist and landscape painter. Baines became the official war artist during the Eighth Frontier War, which lasted from 1850 to 1853. In 1855 he accompanied Augustus Gregory on an expedition across northern <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0chghy">Australia</a> as the official artist and storekeeper, sponsored by the Royal Geographical Society. In 1858, he joined David Livingstoneï¿½s Zambezi expedition in the same capacity. However, the two men did not get along and Baines was forced to return to Cape Town before the party reached Victoria Falls. In 1861, Baines teamed up with James Chapman on his journey from South-West Africa to Victoria Falls along the Zambezi River. This trip was fruitful, producing numerous paintings of the falls by Baines, photographs by Chapman, and each published their account of the journey; Bainesï¿½ was Explorations in South-West Africa (1864). He returned to England in 1865 but found his way back to <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0dg3n1">Africa</a> in 1868, where he continued to explore Southern Africa until his death in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m01tjvv">Durban</a> in 1875.

"I am pretty much done with this consultation for now,"  Xaba is quoted as he stepped back appraising this lithographic printing plate he had been working on for the past few days. Nhlanhla''s way of working was as unusual in his creative use of language. He worked slowly and considered very carefully every mark he made. The content of the work is what mattered to him, the layers of meaning and significance that are embedded in a work. Making art is not something that came spontaneously or easily to him. He literally had to build a work, one brick at a time.

In 1986, he joined the African Institute of Art at the Funda Centre in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0729t">Soweto</a>, where he trained as an art teacher and taught both children and adults.

The <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06msq">sculpture</a> was created in 1912 when Eloff visited Steyn on his farm Onze Rust. Eloff created eight copies of the sculpture. Short Biography: The sculptor, better known as Fanie, was born in 1885 in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a> South Africa. In 1910 his father sent him to <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0f8l9c">France</a> to study mining ï¿½ after spending a couple of months in Paris he decided to rather study art. This had his father livid and he was cut off financially. In 1912, at the 130th Salon exhibition at the Grand Palais de Champs-Elysees in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m05qtj">Paris</a>, Fanie was the only sculptor to compete against the world-famous French sculptor, <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0wgm">Auguste Rodin</a> (1840 ï¿½ 1917). When Rodin took part in a competition all the sculptors of Paris withdrew their entries as they complained that they simply could not win against such as formidable artist. This did not deter Eloff, who was also the grandson of the Late President <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m010f4d">Paul Kruger</a> (of the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek), he entered the competition with this work titled ''The Boxer''. Eloff walked away with the prize and received much praise for this feat. Not only did he win the prize, he also sent a newspaper clipping home to his mother, who in turn showed it to his father. Eloffï¿½s Father was rather impressed and decided that the boy had artistic talent, and he reinstated his financial aid to his son. After this Eloffed moved between South Africa and France and became famous for his figures of ballet dancers and sportsmen. Eloff had to flee Paris with the advent of the Second World War (1939-1945) and permanently returned to South Africa. He dies in Pretoria in 1947 during emergency surgery.',

He learnt art through reading books and met his fellow artists through reading the book, Contemporary <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0dg3n1">African</a> Art in South Africa (1971) by EJ de Jager and as a result Malemane began experimenting with woodcuts. In the late 1970s, he was moved to the Department of Fine Arts where he was further inspired by the Rorkeï¿½s Drift Art School  in Natal considered one of the most prolific art schools for black artists during Apartheid. Malemaneï¿½s work is about the immortalisation of tribal traditions, something he realized would soon disappear in a modern society. This Malemane''s etchings were donated to the University of Pretoria by Carla Wasserthal. The collection belonged to her husband, Klaus Wasserthal (1927-2012) who collected African arts during the many exhibitions he held at his candle-making gallery in Pretoria.

He adapted acrylic or oil painting to this technique to give an earthy texture to his works. Sibeko founded the the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0729t">Soweto</a> Art Gallery and was a founder member of FUBA  or the Federated Union of Black Artists.

In the top left, there is a <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m015p6">bird</a> of prey which shares an eye with the man.

He worked at the Jubilee Art Centre in 1962, alongside Cecil Skotnes, Bill Hart, Ezrom Legae and Sydney Kumalo.

He then worked for the SABC as a graphic artist. Matsotso works are recognised as work that negates literal commentary,  but rather owes its value to its presence. As a graphic artist and painter, Matsotso has produced a wide body of work encompassing both colour and monochromatic artworks. His works are intricate, combined with sculptural figures, yet juxtaposed on a back setting of blank backgrounds.  Although drawing was a favoured medium for several black artists of the period, due to its accessibility, Matsosoï¿½s technique set him apart from the artists making work during that time. Matsoso was associated with the Goodman Gallery (where he exhibited between 1970 and 1988) and represented South Africa at the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m022pfm">Sao Paulo</a> Biennale in 1973 and 1979.

He was also invited by the Department of National Education in 1981 to submit work for the controversial <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0j8ln">Valparaiso</a> Biennial in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m01p1v">Chile</a>, although the content of his work was subsequently rejected as being politically unsuitable.

Eros, the Greek god of love, sexual intercourse, cupids, desire and pleasure was <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m04ztj">married</a> to Psyche, a human girl he fell in love with by accidently scratching himself with one of his arrows. Short biography. The Johannesburg born artist, Christo Coetzee pursued his art studies at the Slade School of Art in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m04jpl">London</a> as a complementary tuition exercise to his fine art degree qualification acquired from the University of the Witwatersrand in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0g284">Johannesburg</a> South Africa.

After completing his studies he moved to Europe on a Government Travelling Scholarship and become part of the Stadler Stable in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m05qtj">Paris</a> before moving to Finestrat in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06mkj">Spain</a>. Later, Coetzee went to <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m03_3d">Japan</a> where he was invited to join the Gutai Group, the first radical Art Group in post-war Japan. It was in Japan that Coetzee developed his later art style that ultimately classified him as <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0hzlz">South Africa''s</a> leading and prominent avant-garde artists. Coetzee received international recognition for his contribution to the avant-garde art movements known as Art Informel, Assemblage and Neo-Baroque in Paris, Spain and Japan during the 1950s and 1960s, an art style he perfected.

The University of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a> purchased the work directly from the artist in 2011.

She felt a need to continue her clay work until 1983 when she met the sculptor Nelson Makhuba who inspired her to start sculpting in wood for a living. Mabasa only received formal schooling for one year and is a self taught artist. Her skill made her the first black woman, and the only Venda woman in South Africa, to become a famous wood carver. She also began to create works which followed more contemporary themes. Her figures of traditional ceremonies, women with babies, and those that capture daily life around her reflect profound expressiveness and mastering of her <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m01mrgs">craft</a>. She conveys the experience of apartheid from a Venda womenï¿½s perspective focusing in the exploration of her origins, displacement, race, and sex. Her work contemplates the feeling of social rejection, censure, and disapproval that comes with diverging from the established guidelines of accepted and expected behaviour. Although she had no formal art training, Mabasaï¿½s natural artistic talent manifests extreme sensitivity. This has given her national and international recognition. In 1985, she was introduced to Ditike ï¿½ The Craft House of Venda, a project of the Venda Development Corporation which recognized her ability, and began promoting her work.',

After moving around extensively as a boy, his family settled in Pretoria North.

He learnt art through reading books and met his fellow artists through reading the book, Contemporary <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0dg3n1">African</a> Art in South Africa (1971) by EJ de Jager and as a result Malemane began experimenting with woodcuts. In the late 1970s, he was moved to the Department of Fine Arts where he was further inspired by the Rorkeï¿½s Drift Art School  in Natal considered one of the most prolific art schools for black artists during Apartheid.

This small plaque was cast by the foundry John Galizia in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m04jpl">London</a> in the 1930s. Short biography: Anton van Wouw was born on 26 December 1862 in Driebergen in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m059j2">the Netherlands</a>. After school, Van Wouw began as a stucco worker in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m029t1">Delft</a> where he learnt the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06msq">art of sculpture</a>. He studied at the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06hdk">Rotterdam</a> Academy for Arts, but stopped his studies to join his father and brother in South Africa. After having a hard time as an artist in the early beginnings of his career of the then Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek (South African Republic 1852-1902) Van Wouw was finally recognised for his work when Sammy Marks (1884-1920), a Lithuanian-born South African industrialist and financier, commissioned Van Wouw to create the famous Kruger Memorial, currently situated on Church Square in the centre of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0hzlz">South Africa''s</a> Capital city Pretoria. From there, Van Wouw''s art went from strength to strength creating over 10 large <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m01brf">bronze</a> monuments, as well as more than 100 other sculptures in his lifetime. Anton van Wouw passed away in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a> in 1945.',

The sculpture depicts a nameless black man, possibly standing in the dock. An "accused" is a person who has been arrested or formally charged with a crime. It is also a common name for the defendant in a criminal case. At the time, Van Wouw was commenting on a man, he knew was unable to understand the Dutch language used in legal courts at the time, and that the ''accused'' probably did not even know what he was accused of or the consequences. Van Wouw created the work as part of his 1907 series, works intended for the Anton van Wouw Syndicate, a group of ''art lovers'' who paid Van Wouw to create 10 selected works of his choice. The sculpture was cast in bronze in 1976 in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m031y2">Florence</a>, <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m03rjj">Italy</a>, at the Fonderia Ferdinando Marinelli.

    'A lithograph titled, Kya Rosa by the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0hzlz">South African</a> artist Jean Kotze-Louw (1929-2014). The work was done for the 50th celebration of the founding of the University of Pretoria in 1980. In 1930, the University changed from being  the Tranvsaal University College (TUC or Tuks) to the University of Pretoria. The building is an interpretation of the first photograph of the first University building known popularly as Kya Rosa, a  Late Victorian house today situated at the University of Pretoria entrance. The original building was constructed in Skinner Street in 1895 in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a> and belonged to Leo Weinthal, owner of The Press a forerunner of Pretoria News.  The house was named after his wife, Rosa. The word ï¿½Kyaï¿½ is the Zulu word for ï¿½houseï¿½. Kya Rosa later became the first home of the then Transvaal University College (TUC) , but by 1915 it was no longer in use. In 1980, the University commissioned the construction of a replica of the house where it stands today ï¿½ at the Roper Street entrance to the University of Pretoria. Work began in 1983, under the guidance of architect Albrecht Holm, an alumnus of UP. Precise measurements were taken from the original building and old photographs were used as reference to ensure that the reconstructed building closely resembles the original house. Many of the original Victorian fittings were used in the reconstruction. Kya Rosa was officially opened by Dr Anton Rupert on 25 October 1985. Short Biography: Jean Kotze-Louw was born in 1929 in Lichtenburg in the North West Province. She studied fine arts from 1947 to 1951 at the University of Natal and after winning the Emma Smith Scholarship in 1950, she continued her studies in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m03rjj">Italy</a>, and <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0f8l9c">France</a>. Between 1958 and 1960, she commenced her career as an academic lecturer in mosaic at the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m01ybj9">Positano</a> Art Workshop in Italy. In 1975,  she became a lecturer of Visual Design and Painting at the University of Pretoria. Kotze-Louw passed away in 2014.',

This work gives a sense of gender inequality as the iron in the work casts its shadow over the portraits of some of the women in the work. An iron marked with the word ï¿½DEFYï¿½ and a woman pressed into the side standing in angst in the dark makes one feel that violence has occurred and the woman standing might have been marked for her disobedience by means of this very same iron she uses to make him representable and respected by society. Victor also plays on the word defy, which refers to a well-known South African appliance brand ''Defy''. Why Defy forms part of Victorï¿½s most notable and ongoing ï¿½Disasters of Peaceï¿½ series, which was inspired by <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m02y23">Francisco de Goya</a>ï¿½s (1746-1828) sequence of etchings ï¿½Disasters of Warï¿½ (1810-1820). In this series of the ï¿½Disasters of Peaceï¿½, Victor addresses the aftermath of apartheid and the ongoing struggles for peace and justice in South Africa. Victor conveys powerful commentary on the effects of violence and conflict and the toll it takes on individuals and communities as portrayed through daily media coverage. Through her use of vivid imagery and bold mark making, Victor conveys the devastating impact of murder, racism, corruption, oppression, poverty and the ongoing struggle for recovery and healing. The ï¿½Disasters of Peaceï¿½ series explores brutality and grievances that are so frequent that they no longer raise outcry from the South African public. The ï¿½Disasters of Peaceï¿½  has been widely acclaimed for its unflinching honesty and its ability to confront difficult topics within the irony of daily life. Short Biography: Diane Victor is a prominent South African artist born in 1964. She is best known for her printmaking, drawing, smoke drawing, and installation works that address political and social issues. Victor received her training at the University of the Witwatersrand and has since established herself as a significant figure in the South African and international art scene. Her works have been widely exhibited both locally and internationally and are held in major public and private collections. She won the SASOL New Signatures Award in 1987 and became the youngest recipient of the Volkskas Atelier Award in 1988. In addition to her artistic practice, Victor has also been involved with the University of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a> as a lecturer and visiting artist.',

    'A mixed media work (1997-1998) titled, Tree of Knowledge: Broken Garden by the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0hzlz">South African</a> sculptor Willem Boshoff (b.1951). In his artist''s statement Boshoff provides the following description to this work. "The Tree of Knowledge series commemorates the tree in its sacrificial form -- the book. It also anticipates the end of the book (if that were possible). Although the computer makes its own demands on the natural environment, in the Tree of Knowledge series I follow a serious, albeit wishful, <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m07jdr">train</a> of thought -- that there will come a time when the computer, with its built-in calculus or silicone chip, could release us from our dependency on the book as our instrument of computation and storage of information. Before the invention of paper, knowledge was managed and recorded by various means. Druids and seers made use of prehistoric ''stationery'' such as bones, wrinkles, stars and, more particularly, stones, to muse on facts and figures. The world''s oldest ''computer'' is arguably the psephos of the Greeks or the calculus of the Romans, the pebble, which was an instrument of thought and reckoning. In Druid''s keyboard I emphasise the change-over from the ''age of the pebble'' to the ''age of paper". The 36 individual pebbles made from 36 species of wood represent paper''s dependency on wood, and the 26 letters and ten numerals  are used in the common western alphabet and in most counting systems. The druids reflected on large stone <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m09l0j_">rings</a>, or smaller objects arranged in circles, showing regard for cyclical change as observed in the sun, planets and seasons. Their world was round and in motion, a world-view in sharp contrast to the flat and square one we obtain from the compressed, four-sided pages of books. Computers are still in their infancy, but at present they seem more likely to contribute to the excessive consumption of paper than to reduce it. This puts our ecological environment under severe pressure, as forests are destroyed to supply the ever-growing demand for a writing surface. Books are some of the most desirable objects on earth: yet few people realise that what libraries contain is innumerable trees, broken and battered beyond recognition. <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0crnb5">Piet Mondrian</a> paid homage to the tree in a series of well-known paintings. He contemplated the transformation of the tree from its existence as natural wonder to its role as universal agency, signifying an essentially vertical and horizontal equilibrium. Letters to God also refers to the alliance of the tree to the book as creating a bridge or ladder, which we mount to reach ultimate knowledge or perfection. But, unlike Mondrian''s painting, this work is also mindful of the terrible cost of appropriating real trees for making books. The base of the work uses block-like quaternaries similar to Mondrian''s to convey the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m07j7r">tree''s</a> own architecture. To make paper, we bludgeon the tree into dispirited splinters and slivers. Then we reconstitute these deconstructed, shattered pieces of wood into paper to fulfil the ''noble'' role of bearer of information. The top section of Letters to God spreads out into the fibrous structure of paper as seen under a microscope. Its ''branches'' are literally bits of tree, re-made into the perverted image of yet another tree-- the Tree of Knowledge, represented by paper and the book. The ''letters'' in  Letters to God are those of the Greek alphabet, hidden within the metaphorical branches, so that, should we attempt to pick them, as Eve did, we violate the tree. The title Tree of Knowledge derives from the book of Genesis: ''... from the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat''. The ''tree'' is taken as all the paper and books of the world, and its ''fruit'' is the text and ultimately the ideas that can be harvested from it. Broken Garden is a re-enactment of the crucifixion in which the ''Word of God'' is nailed to the ''tree'' -- Christ nailed to a wooden cross. The spiky splinters of the work are meant to reinforce the idea that knowledge in an alphabetic, book-dependent society comes at a great cost to the universal tree, and that such knowledge causes pain, both to our natural resources and ultimately, as the sole repository of learning, to us. The wood of the work is real timber, battered into splintered pieces with a four-pound hammer to simulate the crucifixion. Broken Garden is divided into 36 wooded sections (the 26 letters of the alphabet plus the ten numerals). Splinters of dark hardwood provide the dividing lines in a configuration of four noughts-and-crosses patterns. The cross in the centre, formed by the torn paper, is a crossroad or carfax, a forking into four, signifying the place where the four major academic disciplines meet. The work belongs to the South32 collection on courtesy temporary loan to the University of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a>.

Leyds was a personal friend of Eloff and they often practiced music together as Leyds was an avid <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m07y_7">violinist</a>. In 1884 Leyds would become the State Attorney of the ZAR (the South African Republic in Dutch) and in 1889 the State Secretary of the South African Republic. The sculpture was donated by the artist to the University of Pretoria Merensky Library in 1937 as Leyds donated a vast collection of books to the library. The South African Republic (Dutch: Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek; the ZAR) was an independent and internationally recognised state located in what is now South Africa, from 1852 to 1902. Short Biography: The sculptor, better known as Fanie, was born in 1885 in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a> <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0hzlz">South Africa</a>. In 1910 his father sent him to <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0f8l9c">France</a> to study mining ï¿½ after spending a couple of months in Paris he decided to rather study art. This had his father livid and he was cut off financially. In 1912, at the 130th Salon exhibition at the Grand Palais de Champs-Elysees in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m05qtj">Paris</a>, Fanie was the only sculptor to compete against the world-famous French sculptor, <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0wgm">Auguste Rodin</a> (1840 ï¿½ 1917). When Rodin took part in a competition all the sculptors of Paris withdrew their entries as they complained that they simply could not win against such as formidable artist. This did not deter Eloff, who was also the grandson of the Late President <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m010f4d">Paul Kruger</a> (of the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek), he entered the competition with this work titled ''The Boxer''. Eloff walked away with the prize and received much praise for this feat. Not only did he win the prize, he also sent a newspaper clipping home to his mother, who in turn showed it to his father. Eloffï¿½s Father was rather impressed and decided that the boy had artistic talent, and he reinstated his financial aid to his son. After this Eloffed moved between South Africa and France and became famous for his figures of ballet dancers and sportsmen. Eloff had to flee Paris with the advent of the Second World War (1939-1945) and permanently returned to South Africa. He dies in Pretoria in 1947 during emergency surgery.',

The mountain itself is called ï¿½Koffiebusï¿½ translated as Coffee Container.

The sculpture is of unnamed black man sitting with crossed legs upon a rock, playing a traditional African  instrument called a Skapu. This string instrument , is also called an uhadi in isiXhosa or a umakhweyana in isiZulu. The instrument has a long bow attached to a calabash which resonates the sound. The string is then tapped with a reed or a stick to produce the sound. The players upper torso is unclothed and he is wearing trousers, with no <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06rrc">shoes</a>.

After having a hard time as an artist in the early beginnings of his career of the then Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek (South African Republic 1852-1902) Van Wouw was finally recognised for his work when Sammy Marks (1884-1920),  a Lithuanian-born South African industrialist and financier, commissioned Van Wouw to create the famous Kruger Memorial, currently situated on Church Square in the centre of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0hzlz">South Africa''s</a> Capital city Pretoria.

As a child, Pudi lived a life of poverty, but often watched when his maternal grandfather, David Motladi, a carpenter, was at work. In order to survive, Pudi herded goats for relatives and thus only started school at age 11. Frustrated by his academic deficit, he soon dropped out, joined a local gang and became a street fighter. A forced removal relocated Pudiï¿½s family to Ga-Rankuwa Township outside Pretoria, and the separation from his gangster friends had a positive consequence, as at age 15 he met a teacher who encouraged him to take up <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m083vt">wood</a> carving. He went back to school at age 21, but again became despondent and dropped out. At that point Pudi sought out the company of other artists for advice. He met Motshile Nthodi, an artist who had contact with the Schweickerdt Arts Gallery in Pretoria. Nthodi was impressed by Pudiï¿½s work and helped him to stage his first one man exhibition, which launched his career as artist. Pudiï¿½s works are classified as African expressionistic, his forms are distorted and exaggerated. His wood carvings depict humans in their most abstract forms. He rejects the forms and conformity of naturalism, yet aim to evoke personal emotions. His works are reflections of his upbringing. His naivety to financial security motivates the style and appearance of his works. One of the most prominent figures in his works is the black male figure in his environment.',

    'Jan van Riebeeck was sculpted by the Dutch born South African artist <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m09n5cb">Anton van Wouw</a> (1862-1945). In 1927, Van Wouw created a sculpture of the Dutch colonist, Jan van Riebeeck (1619-1677) for a competition for the facade of the South Africa House in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m04jpl">London</a>. Van Wouw, although one of the final three artists selected, did not win the competition. His work was deemed insufficient as Van Wouw did not have the skill to create the same work in stone as was required. The maquette was therefore never made into a larger sculpture. This <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m01brf">bronze</a> was cast by the Renzo Vignali Artistic Foundry in Pretoria after 1936. It originally belonged to a private collection of Miss D Fraay and was bought by the University of South Africa from a Sotheby''s auction on 8 June 1982 lot 43. Short biography: Anton van Wouw was born on 26 December 1862 in Driebergen in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m059j2">the Netherlands</a>. After school, Van Wouw began as a stucco worker in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m029t1">Delft</a> where he learnt the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06msq">art of sculpture</a>. He studied at the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06hdk">Rotterdam</a> Academy for Arts, but stopped his studies to join his father and brother in South Africa. After having a hard time as an artist in the early beginnings of his career of the then Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek (South African Republic 1852-1902) Van Wouw was finally recognised for his work when Sammy Marks (1884-1920),  a Lithuanian-born South African industrialist and financier, commissioned Van Wouw to create the famous Kruger Memorial, currently situated on Church Square in the centre of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0hzlz">South Africa''s</a> Capital city Pretoria. From there, Van Wouw''s art went from strength to strength creating over 10 large bronze monuments, as well as more than 100 other sculptures in his lifetime. Anton van Wouw passed away in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a> in 1945 just after completing his largest work, a figure of Woman and Children for the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m02cnny">Voortrekker Monument</a> in Pretoria.',

Eloff created the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06msq">sculpture</a> of a younger version of his friend in 1942. The story told about Grobler is that an Austrian composer Franz Lehar kidnapped Grobler in 1920 whilst he was living with Eloff in Paris. Eloff then flew his Gypsy Moth plane to <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0fhp9">Vienna</a> to save Grobler. Grobler was the model for most of Eloff''s male figures. Short Biography: The sculptor, better known as Fanie, was born in 1885 in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a> South Africa. In 1910 his father sent him to <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0f8l9c">France</a> to study mining ï¿½ after spending a couple of months in Paris he decided to rather study art. This had his father livid and he was cut off financially. In 1912, at the 130th Salon exhibition at the Grand Palais de Champs-Elysees in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m05qtj">Paris</a>, Fanie was the only sculptor to compete against the world-famous French sculptor, <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0wgm">Auguste Rodin</a> (1840 ï¿½ 1917). When Rodin took part in a competition all the sculptors of Paris withdrew their entries as they complained that they simply could not win against such as formidable artist. This did not deter Eloff, who was also the grandson of the Late President <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m010f4d">Paul Kruger</a> (of the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek), he entered the competition with this work titled ''The Boxer''. Eloff walked away with the prize and received much praise for this feat. Not only did he win the prize, he also sent a newspaper clipping home to his mother, who in turn showed it to his father. Eloffï¿½s Father was rather impressed and decided that the boy had artistic talent, and he reinstated his financial aid to his son. After this Eloffed moved between South Africa and France and became famous for his figures of ballet dancers and sportsmen. Eloff had to flee Paris with the advent of the Second World War (1939-1945) and permanently returned to South Africa. He dies in Pretoria in 1947 during emergency surgery.',

After moving around extensively as a boy, his family settled in Pretoria North. Until 1980, at least, Malemane received no formal institutional training as an artist but worked as a messenger in the Library of the University of South Africa (UNISA) in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a>. He learnt art through reading books and met his fellow artists through reading the book, Contemporary <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0dg3n1">African</a> Art in South Africa (1971) by EJ de Jager and as a result Malemane began experimenting with woodcuts. In the late 1970s, he was moved to the Department of Fine Arts where he was further inspired by the Rorkeï¿½s Drift Art School  in Natal considered one of the most prolific art schools for black artists during Apartheid. Malemaneï¿½s work is about the immortalisation of tribal traditions, something he realized would soon disappear in a modern society. This Malemane''s etchings were donated to the University of Pretoria by Carla Wasserthal. The collection belonged to her husband, Klaus Wasserthal (1927-2012) who collected African arts during the many exhibitions he held at his candle-making gallery in Pretoria.

The painting depicts three simplified black female figures, and other decorative considerations that influence the content, as well as the form of the composition. The flat perspective and interlocking colour planes point to the Fauve tendency (from early 20th century Fauvism to distort color and form) of eliminating the third dimension and forming a decorative surface pattern of interlocking color planes. The painting was donated by the artist in 1988 after a retrospective exhibition held at the University of Pretoria. In 1988, Cilliers-Barnard donated a further 58 works to the University. Short Biography: Bettie Cilliers-Barnard was born Elizabeth Petronella (Bettie) Barnard on 18 November 1914 in the town of Rustenburg, South Africa.

Shortly afterwards her husband was appointed as an Extramural Officer at the University of Pretoria. From this time forward, a very close relationship developed between the Cilliers family and the University of Pretoria. In 1946, Cilliers-Barnard held her first solo-exhibition at the old Extramural building at the University of Pretoria in Vermeulen Street, <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a>.

In 1941, Hendrikz commissioned by Prof Raymond Dart the Anthropologist to create portrait works depicting the heads of the San, Khoi, Pondo, Swazi, Shangaan,  Shona and a Zulu people, seven in total for the Anatomy Museum at the Witwatersrand University in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0g284">Johannesburg</a>. It is unknown if the museum ever acquired copies despite the commission, however in 1948 Dr. G Bï¿½chner, on whose farm Hendrikz had his art studio, bought the set of African head portraits. They were set up in his home next to the swimming pool. Over the years, the heads was exhibited by Hendrikz (loaning them from Bï¿½chner). The head of the Shangaan was exhibited in December 1947 at Christieï¿½s Art Gallery and the Mashona, at the Exhibition of Contemporary South African Paintings, Drawings and Sculpture in 1948 at the Tate Gallery in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m04jpl">London</a>.  At most, Hendrikz works were only cast once or twice and are exceedingly rare with only this bronze Zulu as part of the collection of the University of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a>. Short Biography: Willem de Sanderes Hendrikz was born in 1910 in Brandfort in the Free State. As a young boy, he studied under the German artist, Fritz Hickman. In 1928,  studied architecture at the University of the Witwatersrand and took sculpture lessons at the Johannesburg Technical College. In July 1934, Hendrikz took part in his first major exhibition at the Cooling Gallery in London. After his return to South Africa, he got <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m04ztj">married</a> and began practising sculpture as a full-time artist in Johannesburg. In 1935, he was given his first commission to create the panels for the Red Cross House in Johannesburg. In 1937, he became a lecturer at the University of the Witwatersrand and in 1940 Hendrikz joined the South African forces in North <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0dg3n1">Africa</a> during the Second World War and was reportedly responsible for the creation of camouflage during the war. After the war, he returned to South Africa and continued a career as a full-time sculptor. During his lifetime, Hendrikz was flagged by art critics as <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0hzlz">South Africaï¿½s</a> next great sculptor, but due to war circumstances and ill health, Hendrikz did not create more works. Hendrikz died in 1959 in Plettenberg Bay at the young age of 49. This Zulu sculpture was purchased from Mr CI Rautenbach in 2009 who had bought it directly from Dr G Bï¿½chner, who in turn bought it from artist.',

Short biography: <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m09n5cb">Anton van Wouw</a> was born on 26 December 1862 in Driebergen in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m059j2">the Netherlands</a>.

After having a hard time as an artist in the early beginnings of his career of the then Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek (South African Republic), Van Wouw finally got his big break when Sammy Marks, a rich industrialist, commissioned Van Wouw to create the famous Kruger Memorial, currently situated on Church Square in the centre of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0hzlz">South Africa''s</a> Capital city Pretoria.

As a child, Pudi lived a life of poverty, but often watched when his maternal grandfather, David Motladi, a carpenter, was at work. In order to survive, Pudi herded goats for relatives and thus only started school at age 11. Frustrated by his academic deficit, he soon dropped out, joined a local gang and became a street fighter. A forced removal relocated Pudiï¿½s family to Ga-Rankuwa Township outside Pretoria, and the separation from his gangster friends had a positive consequence, as at age 15 he met a teacher who encouraged him to take up <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m083vt">wood</a> carving. He went back to school at age 21, but again became despondent and dropped out. At that point Pudi sought out the company of other artists for advice. He met Motshile Nthodi, an artist who had contact with the Schweickerdt Arts Gallery in Pretoria. Nthodi was impressed by Pudiï¿½s work and helped him to stage his first one man exhibition, which launched his career as artist. Pudiï¿½s works are classified as African expressionistic, his forms are distorted and exaggerated. His wood carvings depict humans in their most abstract forms. He rejects the forms and conformity of naturalism, yet aim to evoke personal emotions. His works are reflections of his upbringing. His naivety to financial security motivates the style and appearance of his works. One of the most prominent figures in his works is the black male figure in his environment.',

The animal figurine consists of 4 pointed stubs for legs, torso, head, ears and snout. The torso is rounded, however due to material loss, the exact form is not recognisable. At the joining of head and torso, a protruding hump is evident suggestive of an adult male bull of the species bos taurus (cattle). The head is characterised by a two ears which extend horizontally from the sides of the head. The area between the ears is flattened and the face curves slightly outward and falls vertically downward into a pointed snout. The legs are mere extensions of the torso and the animal stands on the pointed ends of the legs. The back side is flattened and no distinguishable tail is apparent.  .',

By 1985 Cilliers-Barnard was moved by the sublimated qualities of time and space in which timelessness and boundlessness became cardinal elements. This ancient symbol of the sun juxtaposed onto a cross-like shape, is central to the composition of this work. On either side of this, there are two figure-like forms which stare at the central symbol in stupefaction. The painting was donated by the artist in 1988 after a retrospective exhibition held at the University of Pretoria and in the same year she donated a further 58 works to the University of Pretoria.

In her long career as an artist, which stretched over more than seven decades, she participated in more than 250 group exhibitions in South Africa and internationally.

In 1918, the University of the Orange Free State in South Africa requested Van Wouw to create a monument dedicated to Martinus Theunis Steyn (1857-1916), the last President of the Free State as an independent Republic. The Committee which had to approve the work did not like the sitting figure and requested the artist to rather create a standing figure. The sculpture was cast in 1928 at the Giovanni Nisini Foundry in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06c62">Rome</a>. Short biography: Anton van Wouw was born on 26 December 1862 in Driebergen in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m059j2">the Netherlands</a>. After school, Van Wouw began as a stucco worker in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m029t1">Delft</a> where he learnt the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06msq">art of sculpture</a>. He studied at the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06hdk">Rotterdam</a> Academy for Arts, but stopped his studies to join his father and brother in South Africa. After having a hard time as an artist in the early beginnings of his career of the then Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek (South African Republic 1852-1902) Van Wouw was finally recognised for his work when Sammy Marks (1884-1920),  a Lithuanian-born South African industrialist and financier, commissioned Van Wouw to create the famous Kruger Memorial, currently situated on Church Square in the centre of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0hzlz">South Africa''s</a> Capital city Pretoria. From there, Van Wouw''s art went from strength to strength creating over 10 large <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m01brf">bronze</a> monuments, as well as more than 100 other sculptures in his lifetime. Anton van Wouw passed away in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a> in 1945 just after completing his largest work, a figure of Woman and Children for the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m02cnny">Voortrekker Monument</a> in Pretoria.',

Vetkatï¿½s works are in private collections at the Natal Museum Services, the McGregor Museum at <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m01tjpx">Kimberley</a> and at the University of Pretoria. From 2002 to 2005, his art was displayed at the United Nations (UN) as part of an exhibition of indigenous art, while his 2004 tour of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m09c7w0">the United States of America</a> culminated in his addressing the UN. Shortly before his death in 2007, Vetkat was invited by the Department of Built Environment at the University of Pretoria to do a solo exhibition on the University of Pretoria campus. All the works on exhibit were purchased by the University of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a>, and constitutes the largest assemblage of the artistï¿½s works in a single collection, now curated by the University of Pretoria Museums.',

Although Van Wouw is better known for his sculpture in South Africa he started his career in the country as a painter. This scene he depict is of Hove''s Drift near the centre of the city Pretoria, today. In the far background a mining operation can be seen.

He also started to study at the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06hdk">Rotterdam</a> Academy for Arts but stopped his studies to join his father and brother in South Africa. After having a hard time as an artist in the early beginnings of his career of the then Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek (South African Republic), Van Wouw finally got his big break when Sammy Marks, a rich industrialist, commissioned Van Wouw to create the famous Kruger Memorial, currently situated on Church Square in the centre of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0hzlz">South Africa''s</a> Capital city Pretoria. From there, Van Wouw went from creating over 10 large monuments, as well as more than 100 other sculptures in his lifetime.

The <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m068jd">photograph</a> is detail from the tail segment of the gecko which is severed as a triggered defense response. Short biography: Nicola Grobler was born in 1976. She obtained a degree in Fine Art with distinction from the University of Pretoria, before relocating to <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m04jpl">London</a> to pursue her interest in graphic design and digital media. She returned to <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m01yj2">Cape Town</a> in 2002 and was awarded a Master of Fine Art, with distinction, from the Michaelis School of Fine Art, in 2004. She was the team leader for the interdisciplinary SANParks / SANParks Honorary Rangers project (2012-2013), which involved the Department of Drama and the Information Design section. She facilitated a series of public interventions, entitled #Intersections, for the Cool Capital Biennale 2014, as part of the Fine Arts curriculum. Groblerï¿½s creative and theoretical research is focused on artistic practices in relation to human-animal entanglements, urban ecology, the everyday, aesthetics, participation and agency. She completed her Fine Arts PhD at the University of Cape Town and was the recipient of the National Research Foundation of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0hzlz">South Africaï¿½s</a> Thuthuka grant and the University of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a>ï¿½s Vice-Chancellorï¿½s grant (2016).

She operates with a different optic, which assesses and reconsiders the value of things. Her work reflects a concern with the economy of value in a world fixated with the concrete. By infusing the ordinary with the poetic she shows other possibilities for describing human relations to the world and with each other. Grobler has participated in numerous group exhibitions and solo exhibitions. She is a lecturer in Fine Art studio practice and contemporary art discourse at the Department of Visual Arts at the University of Pretoria.',

He learnt art through reading books and met his fellow artists through reading the book, Contemporary <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0dg3n1">African</a> Art in South Africa (1971) by EJ de Jager and as a result Malemane began experimenting with woodcuts. In the late 1970s, he was moved to the Department of Fine Arts where he was further inspired by the Rorkeï¿½s Drift Art School  in Natal considered one of the most prolific art schools for black artists during Apartheid. Malemaneï¿½s work is about the immortalisation of tribal traditions, something he realized would soon disappear in a modern society. This Malemane''s etchings were donated to the University of Pretoria by Carla Wasserthal. The collection belonged to her husband, Klaus Wasserthal (1927-2012) who collected African arts during the many exhibitions he held at his candle-making gallery in Pretoria. Wasserthal was known for his significant role he played at the Rorke''s Drift tapestry project which has since gained international recognition.',

The painting was part of the National Educational College collection and came to the University when the college became part of UP in 2001. Short Biography: <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m043cgm">Jacob Hendrik</a> (Henk) Pierneef was born in 1886 in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a>, South Africa. As a child, he studied art at school, along with other students who would later become well-known artists, such as <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0h52rv3">Fanie Eloff</a> for sculpture and Gordon Leith for architecture. In 1900, Pierneef went with his parents to <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m059j2">The Netherlands</a> as a means to avoid the hostilities of the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0bqtx">South African War</a> (1899-1902) where he studied at the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06hdk">Rotterdam</a> Art Academy. Pierneef returned to South Africa in 1904 and studied under the prominent artists <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m09n5cb">Anton van Wouw</a>, <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0gh6wcz">Frans Oerder</a> and Hugo Naude. In 1913, Pierneef had his first solo exhibition and rapidly became one of the most recognised names in South African art. In 1929 he was commissioned to create panels for the new <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0g284">Johannesburg</a> Railway station, a project which today would be seen as one of his greatest achievements. Pierneef received an honorary doctorate from the University of Pretoria in 1957 in recognition of his work, shortly after in the same year he passed away in Pretoria.',

Short biography: Anton van Wouw was born on 26 December 1862 in Driebergen in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m059j2">the Netherlands</a>. After school, Van Wouw began as a stucco worker in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m029t1">Delft</a> where he learnt the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06msq">art of sculpture</a>. He studied at the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06hdk">Rotterdam</a> Academy for Arts, but stopped his studies to join his father and brother in South Africa. After having a hard time as an artist in the early beginnings of his career of the then Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek (South African Republic 1852-1902) Van Wouw was finally recognised for his work when Sammy Marks (1884-1920),  a Lithuanian-born South African industrialist and financier, commissioned Van Wouw to create the famous Kruger Memorial, currently situated on Church Square in the centre of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0hzlz">South Africa''s</a> Capital city Pretoria. From there, Van Wouw art went from strength to strength creating over 10 large bronze monuments, as well as more than 100 other sculptures in his lifetime. Anton van Wouw passed away in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a> in 1945 just after completing his largest work, a figure of Woman and Children for the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m02cnny">Voortrekker Monument</a> in Pretoria.',

The work is part of a series purchased by the University of Pretoria in 2007. The series comments on the artist''s spiritual journey through the transmutation ceremonies of the San people, Christianity as well as his personal journey through living in the veld to being integrated to modern society. Short Biography: Vetkat Kruiper Regopstaan Boesman (mostly referred to as Vetkat Kruiper) was born in 1969 in Twee Rivieren and was a member of the Khomani San tribe in what is today known as the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park region. His father was a healer and crafter in his community, and clearly had a huge impact on Vetkatï¿½s art knowledge and understanding of San culture and customs. vetkat is one of very few San artists who sustained the ï¿½lostï¿½ (according to some) tradition of San rock art, but with ink on <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0641k">paper</a> as medium. The animality, spirituality and symbolism in Vetkatï¿½s works has been the topic of several academic studies. Vetkatï¿½s works are in private collections at the Natal Museum Services, the McGregor Museum at <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m01tjpx">Kimberley</a> and at the University of Pretoria. From 2002 to 2005, his art was displayed at the United Nations (UN) as part of an exhibition of indigenous art, while his 2004 tour of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m09c7w0">the United States of America</a> culminated in his addressing the UN. Shortly before his death in 2007, Vetkat was invited by the Department of Built Environment at the University of Pretoria to do a solo exhibition on the University of Pretoria campus. All the works on exhibit were purchased by the University of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a>, and constitutes the largest assemblage of the artistï¿½s works in a single collection, now curated by the University of Pretoria Museums.',

Short Biography: Wynand Steyl was born in 1923 in Modderfontein, Johannesburg. He grew up herding sheep on his parentsï¿½ farm, where his love for nature and ability to observe, was shaped. In later years, he worked for the Department of Agriculture. He always carried a sketch pad with him as his job demanded of him to travel frequently. His sketches in his personal work pads were only done in Indian <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m03yhk">ink</a>, pen or pencil, due to the fact that he was colour-blind. However, he did paint in colour, but became better known for his <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06msq">sculptures</a> and woodcuts. Steyl viewed his own work as semi-abstract, but admitted that he never diverged from nature. All that is known about Wynandï¿½s works is that he, much like <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m043cgm">Pierneef</a>, liked to create art in nature. Steyl had a great love of nature and natural landscapes. His passion for drawing began in the Karoo and he never stopped after that. He often went on trips to the Kruger National Park which is where he would carve and sketch. Each carving captures the moment and presents itself as almost three dimensional. Steyl passed away in Ladysmith in 2014.',

The painting was created after the artist''s interior of his studio which he named Yggdrasil. The artist''s colour palette is recognisable in the work as you see the blue green colours typical of his oeuvre. The sun <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0c9ph5">flowers</a> in the foreground are a tribute to the artist <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m07_m2">Vincent van Gogh</a>. The painting is in Preller''s typical surrealist style and takes the viewer on a journey through the artist''s imaginary world. Prellerï¿½s studio was so important to him that he named it ï¿½Yggdrasilï¿½. The word Yggdrasil means ï¿½World <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m07j7r">Tree</a>ï¿½ or ï¿½Tree of Lifeï¿½, as it refers to the cycle of birth, growth, death and rebirth. As with the significant meaning of his studioï¿½s name, the objects Preller painted are also loaded with metaphysical significance. Short biography: Preller was born in Pretoria in 1911. Preller''s home and studio was designed by the architect Norman Eaton in 1944 on Preller''s Farm near Broederstroom. Preller died on the farm in 1975.

The <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06msq">sculpture</a> was created for the wall of Eloff''s home near the Paris Observatory in France along with another work titled, Viennese Dancer. This work was donated to the University of Pretoria in 1937 by the artist. Short biography: The sculptor, better known as Fanie, was born in 1885 in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a> South Africa. In 1910 his father sent him to <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0f8l9c">France</a> to study mining ï¿½ after spending a couple of months in Paris he decided to rather study art. This had his father livid and he was cut off financially. In 1912, at the 130th Salon exhibition at the Grand Palais de Champs-Elysees in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m05qtj">Paris</a>, Fanie was the only sculptor to compete against the world-famous French sculptor, <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0wgm">Auguste Rodin</a> (1840 ï¿½ 1917). When Rodin took part in a competition all the sculptors of Paris withdrew their entries as they complained that they simply could not win against such as formidable artist. This did not deter Eloff, who was also the grandson of the Late President <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m010f4d">Paul Kruger</a> (of the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek), he entered the competition with this work titled ''The Boxer''. Eloff walked away with the prize and received much praise for this feat. Not only did he win the prize, he also sent a newspaper clipping home to his mother, who in turn showed it to his father. Eloffï¿½s Father was rather impressed and decided that the boy had artistic talent, and he reinstated his financial aid to his son. After this Eloffed moved between South Africa and France and became famous for his figures of ballet dancers and sportsmen. Eloff had to flee Paris with the advent of the Second World War (1939-1945) and permanently returned to South Africa. He dies in Pretoria in 1947 during emergency surgery.',

Short Biography: Wynand Steyl was born in 1923 in Modderfontein, Johannesburg. He grew up herding sheep on his parentsï¿½ farm, where his love for nature and ability to observe, was shaped. In later years, he worked for the Department of Agriculture. He always carried a sketch pad with him as his job demanded of him to travel frequently. His sketches in his personal work pads were only done in Indian <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m03yhk">ink</a>, pen or pencil, due to the fact that he was colour-blind. However, he did paint in colour, but became better known for his sculptures and woodcuts. Steyl viewed his own work as semi-abstract, but admitted that he never diverged from nature. All that is known about Wynandï¿½s works is that he, much like <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m043cgm">Pierneef</a>, liked to create art in nature. Steyl had a great love of nature and natural landscapes. His passion for drawing began in the Karoo and he never stopped after that. He often went on trips to the Kruger National Park which is where he would carve and sketch. Each carving captures the moment and presents itself as almost three dimensional. Steyl passed away in Ladysmith in 2014.',

The Hemidactylus mabouia is the common house gecko. The photograph is detail from the tail segment of the gecko which is severed as a triggered defense response. Short biography: Nicola Grobler was born in 1976. She obtained a degree in Fine Art with distinction from the University of Pretoria, before relocating to <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m04jpl">London</a> to pursue her interest in graphic design and digital media. She returned to <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m01yj2">Cape Town</a> in 2002 and was awarded a Master of Fine Art, with distinction, from the Michaelis School of Fine Art, in 2004. She was the team leader for the interdisciplinary SANParks / SANParks Honorary Rangers project (2012-2013), which involved the Department of Drama and the Information Design section. She facilitated a series of public interventions, entitled #Intersections, for the Cool Capital Biennale 2014, as part of the Fine Arts curriculum. Groblerï¿½s creative and theoretical research is focused on artistic practices in relation to human-animal entanglements, urban ecology, the everyday, aesthetics, participation and agency. She completed her Fine Arts PhD at the University of Cape Town and was the recipient of the National Research Foundation of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0hzlz">South Africaï¿½s</a> Thuthuka grant and the University of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a>ï¿½s Vice-Chancellorï¿½s grant (2016).

She operates with a different optic, which assesses and reconsiders the value of things. Her work reflects a concern with the economy of value in a world fixated with the concrete. By infusing the ordinary with the poetic she shows other possibilities for describing human relations to the world and with each other.

Short Biography: Wynand Steyl was born in 1923 in Modderfontein, Johannesburg. He grew up herding sheep on his parentsï¿½ farm, where his love for nature and ability to observe, was shaped. In later years, he worked for the Department of Agriculture. He always carried a sketch pad with him as his job demanded of him to travel frequently. His sketches in his personal work pads were only done in Indian ink, pen or pencil, due to the fact that he was colour-blind. However, he did paint in colour, but became better known for his sculptures and woodcuts. Steyl viewed his own work as semi-abstract, but admitted that he never diverged from nature. All that is known about Wynandï¿½s works is that he, much like <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m043cgm">Pierneef</a>, liked to create art in nature. Steyl had a great love of nature and natural landscapes. His passion for drawing began in the Karoo and he never stopped after that. He often went on trips to the Kruger National Park which is where he would carve and sketch. Each carving captures the moment and presents itself as almost three dimensional. Steyl passed away in Ladysmith in 2014.',

    'Stanley Pinker',
    '1992',
    'A painting by the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0hzlz">South African</a> artist Stanley Pinker. The painting Kos is op die Tafel (Dinner is served), painted in 1992, refers to the Afrikaans idiom meaning that the meal is ready. The work shows a white man seated at a table with his knife and fork in his hands, ready to eat.  On the table in front of him there is a <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m02dl1y">hat</a>.  Most likely this refers to the saying `Iï¿½d rather eat my hatï¿½.  Next to the man there is a black man serving bones.   The black man is dressed like a servant, but is actually standing behind a screen on which the figure of a servant is painted. If one looks at the servantï¿½s feet, one notices that he is wearing a pair of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06rrc">shoes</a> that appear to be more expensive than those worn by the man at the table. In the background there are empty boxes.  Everything seems to point to a lack of money. The painting has a strong political message and it attempts to give a visual impression of the fear in the white community preceding the change of government in South Africa in 1994.',

Mabaso''s father, a commercial printer, introduced his son to the world of printing presses, paper and ink at a young age. Mabaso took a turn away from the commercial world of printing and began exploring the possibilities of original prints during his time studying at Rorke''s Drift where he studied  in 1975. Mabasoï¿½s drawings, prints and paintings are translations of his subjective experience  and observations of his life, whereabouts, music, politics and power. His work is humanistic, individualized and soulfully in love with South Africa and her people.Mabaso passed away after a long illness in September 2013 at age 58.',

Coster was the State Attorney for the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek (South African Republic) from 1895 to 1897. When the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0bqtx">South African War</a> broke out in 1899, he became part of the Boer volunteers, but was killed in action at the Battle of Elandslaagte on 21 October 1899. Van Wouw completed this portraiture sketch in 1902 for a memorial in the Palace of Justice in Pretoria. The <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m068jd">photograph</a> of the Van Wouw sketch was taken by the South African art historian and lecturer Murray Schoonraad (1932-1991), while he was compiling the Anton van Wouw Archive in 1981. Short biography: Anton van Wouw was born on 26 December 1862 in Driebergen in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m059j2">the Netherlands</a>. He started life after school as a stucco worker in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m029t1">Delft</a> where he learnt to sculpt. He also started to study at the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06hdk">Rotterdam</a> Academy for Arts but stopped his studies to join his father and brother in South Africa. After having a hard time as an artist in the early beginnings of his career of the then Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek (South African Republic), Van Wouw finally got his big break when Sammy Marks, a rich industrialist, commissioned Van Wouw to create the famous Kruger Memorial, currently situated on Church Square in the centre of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0hzlz">South Africa''s</a> Capital city Pretoria. From there, Van Wouw went from creating over 10 large monuments, as well as more than 100 other sculptures in his lifetime. Anton van Wouw passed away in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a> in 1945 just after completing his largest work, a figure of Woman and Children for the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m02cnny">Voortrekker Monument</a>.',

    'A oil on Canvas painting titled Bamboo (1984) by the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0hzlz">South African</a> artist Michael Heyns (b. 1946). The painting has an interesting history. It was donated to a female residence as a decorative piece without being attributed to an artist. When the residence was revamped in 2011 the painting was donated to the University of Pretoriaï¿½s Art collection. In 2012 it was decided to clean the painting as it was very dirty due to it hanging in a smoking room in the residence. When it was cleaned the artist signature was found under the dirt and grime. Short Biography: Michael Heyns was born in Potchefstroom in the North West Province in 1946 and obtained his BA Fine Arts Degree from the University of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a> in 1967. In that same year he was the winner of the South African Art Associationï¿½s New Signatures competition, a competition that is still going strong to this day. Heynsï¿½ works are deeply influenced by music and rhythm.',

    'The painting titled, Bust of Sisyphus I is by the South African artist Christo Coetzee (1929-2000). Sisyphus was a Greek king punished by Zeus for his extreme arrogance. Sisyphus had to roll a boulder up a hill just to have it roll down again. This punishment was maddening and was selected for Sisyphus for his hubristic belief that his cleverness surpassed that of Zeus. Coetzee''s depiction of Sisyphus places this bust among several strange objects, as well as in the background to the right an applied art painting. This painting shows the maddening effect of the art on the artist. Coetzee intended this a joke on the artist and art historians of the time who often had a self-inflated confidence or overly proud or hubristic images of themselves. Short biography. The Johannesburg born artist, Christo Coetzee pursued his art studies at the Slade School of Art in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m04jpl">London</a> as a complementary tuition exercise to his fine art degree qualification acquired from the University of the Witwatersrand in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0g284">Johannesburg</a> South Africa. Most of Coetzee''s works are mainly colourful, stylized figurative images and still lifes. After completing his studies he moved to Europe on an Government Travelling Scholarship  and become part of the Stadler Stable in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m05qtj">Paris</a> before moving to Finestrat in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06mkj">Spain</a>. Later, Coetzee went to <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m03_3d">Japan</a> where he was invited to join the Gutai Group, the first radical Art Group in post-war Japan. It was in Japan that Coetzee developed his later art style that ultimately classified him as <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0hzlz">South Africa''s</a> leading and prominent avant-garde artists. Coetzee received international recognition for his contribution to the avant-garde art movements known as Art Informel, Assemblage and Neo-Baroque in Paris, Spain and Japan during the 1950s and 1960s, an art style he perfected. He passed away at the age of 71 in 2000 in Tulbagh in the Cape and bequeathed his entire home and collection to the University of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a>.',

After having a hard time as an artist in the early beginnings of his career of the then Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek (South African Republic 1852-1902) Van Wouw was finally recognised for his work when Sammy Marks (1884-1920),  a Lithuanian-born South African industrialist and financier, commissioned Van Wouw to create the famous Kruger Memorial, currently situated on Church Square in the centre of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0hzlz">South Africa''s</a> Capital city Pretoria. From there, Van Wouw art went from strength to strength creating over 10 large <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m01brf">bronze</a> monuments, as well as more than 100 other sculptures in his lifetime. Anton van Wouw passed away in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a> in 1945 just after completing his largest work, a figure of Woman and Children for the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m02cnny">Voortrekker Monument</a> in Pretoria.',

Prof Casper Hendrik Rautenbach (1902-1988) was the sixth Principal of the University of Pretoria and his tenure stretched between 1948 and 1970. The official commission of key portraits and hence, the foundation of what is referred to as the portrait collection within the University of Pretoria, began on 9 September 1974. Prof AN Pelzer (Vice-Rector) suggested that the university commence a commission of key portraits of former Chancellors, <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m01mzpv">Chairs</a> of the Council and Principals or Rectors. Short Biography: Irmin Henkel was born in Renburg, <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m03pbf">Hanover</a> in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0345h">Germany</a> during 1921 and he became a resident of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0hzlz">South Africa</a> in 1951. He was a self-taught artist who mostly specialized in still life and portraits. Art was however not his first occupation, Henkel was a fully qualified orthopaedic surgeon who worked at the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a> Provincial Hospital (today Steve Biko Hospital). During the Second World War he served as a doctor in the German military, practising orthopaedic surgery. Henkel achieved rapid prominence as a portraitist in South Africa, and his skills made him the almost automatic choice for official government commissions. He possessed an engaging insouciant manner and sense of humour, which relaxed the sitter and enabled the artist to observe his characteristic disposition and expressions. His portraits were usually effective likenesses of the subject, but they fluctuate markedly in artistic quality. Henkelï¿½s handling of subject matter other than portraits was relaxed and colourful; his style in all was usually loosely naturalistic as was his many works with <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0c9ph5">flowers</a> and still life subjects.',

As a child, Pudi lived a life of poverty, but often watched when his maternal grandfather, David Motladi, a carpenter, was at work. In order to survive, Pudi herded goats for relatives and thus only started school at age 11. Frustrated by his academic deficit, he soon dropped out, joined a local gang and became a street fighter. A forced removal relocated Pudiï¿½s family to Ga-Rankuwa Township outside Pretoria, and the separation from his gangster friends had a positive consequence, as at age 15 he met a teacher who encouraged him to take up <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m083vt">wood</a> carving. He went back to school at age 21, but again became despondent and dropped out. At that point Pudi sought out the company of other artists for advice. He met Motshile Nthodi, an artist who had contact with the Schweickerdt Arts Gallery in Pretoria. Nthodi was impressed by Pudiï¿½s work and helped him to stage his first one man exhibition, which launched his career as artist. Pudiï¿½s works are classified as African expressionistic, his forms are distorted and exaggerated. His wood carvings depict humans in their most abstract forms. He rejects the forms and conformity of naturalism, yet aim to evoke personal emotions. His works are reflections of his upbringing. His naivety to financial security motivates the style and appearance of his works. One of the most prominent figures in his works is the black male figure in his environment.',

He learnt art through reading books and met his fellow artists through reading the book, Contemporary <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0dg3n1">African</a> Art in South Africa (1971) by EJ de Jager and as a result Malemane began experimenting with woodcuts.

Short Biography: Wynand Steyl was born in 1923 in Modderfontein, Johannesburg. He grew up herding sheep on his parentsï¿½ farm, where his love for nature and ability to observe, was shaped. In later years, he worked for the Department of Agriculture. He always carried a sketch pad with him as his job demanded of him to travel frequently. His sketches in his personal work pads were only done in Indian <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m03yhk">ink</a>, pen or pencil, due to the fact that he was colour-blind. However, he did paint in colour, but became better known for his sculptures and woodcuts. Steyl viewed his own work as semi-abstract, but admitted that he never diverged from nature. All that is known about Wynandï¿½s works is that he, much like <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m043cgm">Pierneef</a>, liked to create art in nature. Steyl had a great love of nature and natural landscapes. His passion for drawing began in the Karoo and he never stopped after that. He often went on trips to the Kruger National Park which is where he would carve and sketch. Each carving captures the moment and presents itself as almost three dimensional. Steyl passed away in Ladysmith in 2014.',

As a child, Pudi lived a life of poverty, but often watched when his maternal grandfather, David Motladi, a carpenter, was at work. In order to survive, Pudi herded goats for relatives and thus only started school at age 11. Frustrated by his academic deficit, he soon dropped out, joined a local gang and became a street fighter. A forced removal relocated Pudiï¿½s family to Ga-Rankuwa Township outside Pretoria, and the separation from his gangster friends had a positive consequence, as at age 15 he met a teacher who encouraged him to take up <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m083vt">wood</a> carving. He went back to school at age 21, but again became despondent and dropped out. At that point Pudi sought out the company of other artists for advice. He met Motshile Nthodi, an artist who had contact with the Schweickerdt Arts Gallery in Pretoria. Nthodi was impressed by Pudiï¿½s work and helped him to stage his first one man exhibition, which launched his career as artist. Pudiï¿½s works are classified as African expressionistic, his forms are distorted and exaggerated. His wood carvings depict humans in their most abstract forms. He rejects the forms and conformity of naturalism, yet aim to evoke personal emotions. His works are reflections of his upbringing. His naivety to financial security motivates the style and appearance of his works. One of the most prominent figures in his works is the black male figure in his environment.',

The painting is not just an experiment in abstraction, but an expression of form that hints at the depiction of a crucifix. The shapes and forms, however, are products of the artist''s vast imagination and the influence on her works by Fauvism. The dramatic composition of this work is vigorously controlled and almost cerebral. When this work was created, Cilliers-Barnard was standing on the brink of a new phase in her artwork, which would be characterized by mystic symbolism. The painting was donated by the artist in 1988 after a retrospective exhibition held at the University of Pretoria. In 1988, Cilliers-Barnard donated a further 58 works to the University. Short Biography: Bettie Cilliers-Barnard was born Elizabeth Petronella (Bettie) Barnard on 18 November 1914 in the town of Rustenburg, South Africa. She completed her BA-degree at the University of Pretoria in 1937. In 1938 she began her career as an art teacher at the Innesdale Intermediary School. From 1939, she lectured in art at the Normal College in Pretoria for three years. On 19 December 1942, she <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m04ztj">married</a> a teacher, Mr. Carl Hanke (Bags) Cilliers and then became Bettie Cilliers-Barnard. Shortly afterwards her husband was appointed as an Extramural Officer at the University of Pretoria. From this time forward, a very close relationship developed between the Cilliers family and the University of Pretoria. In 1946, Cilliers-Barnard held her first solo-exhibition at the old Extramural building at the University of Pretoria in Vermeulen Street, <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a>. In 1948, she travelled to <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0154j">Belgium</a> and France to study further at the Koninklijke Academie voor Schone Kunsten and Hogere Instituten in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0fydw">Antwerp</a> under Professor Julian Creytens and at the Atelier <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0clw1p">Andrï¿½ Lï¿½Hï¿½te</a> in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m05qtj">Paris</a>. In 1956, she went for a second study tour to <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0f8l9c">France</a> and studied art and lithography at the Atelier 17 of Stanley William Hayter and the Atelier Jean-Paul Pons in Paris. In her long career as an artist, which stretched over more than seven decades, she participated in more than 250 group exhibitions in South Africa and internationally. Cilliers-Barnard received three honorary doctorates namely from the Potchefstroom University (1990), from the Rand Afrikaans University (1999) and from the University of Pretoria (2001). In 2010, Cilliers-Barnard passed away shortly after her 75th solo exhibition held at the University of Pretoria.',

She returned to <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m01yj2">Cape Town</a> in 2002 and was awarded a Master of Fine Art, with distinction, from the Michaelis School of Fine Art, in 2004.

She facilitated a series of public interventions, entitled #Intersections, for the Cool Capital Biennale 2014, as part of the Fine Arts curriculum. Groblerï¿½s creative and theoretical research is focused on artistic practices in relation to human-animal entanglements, urban ecology, the everyday, aesthetics, participation and agency.

She operates with a different optic, which assesses and reconsiders the value of things. Her work reflects a concern with the economy of value in a world fixated with the concrete. By infusing the ordinary with the poetic she shows other possibilities for describing human relations to the world and with each other. Grobler has participated in numerous group exhibitions and solo exhibitions.

The notion of language in her work is explored within the meaning and experiences of individualism, especially concerning the physical and emotional senses that is related to humans and animals. Lila works across disciplines such a painting, drawing, bead <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06msq">sculpture</a>, performance and writing.

Short Biography: Vetkat Kruiper Regopstaan Boesman (mostly referred to as Vetkat Kruiper) was born in 1969 in Twee Rivieren and was a member of the Khomani San tribe in what is today known as the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park region. His father was a healer and crafter in his community, and clearly had a huge impact on Vetkatï¿½s art knowledge and understanding of San culture and customs. vetkat is one of very few San artists who sustained the ï¿½lostï¿½ (according to some) tradition of San rock art, but with ink on <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0641k">paper</a> as medium. The animality, spirituality and symbolism in Vetkatï¿½s works has been the topic of several academic studies. Vetkatï¿½s works are in private collections at the Natal Museum Services, the McGregor Museum at <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m01tjpx">Kimberley</a> and at the University of Pretoria. From 2002 to 2005, his art was displayed at the United Nations (UN) as part of an exhibition of indigenous art, while his 2004 tour of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m09c7w0">the United States of America</a> culminated in his addressing the UN.

    'Delville Wood, Landscape with Crater was painted by <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0hzlz">South African</a> artist Bertha Everard (1873-1965). Delville Wood was a battle fought between the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m07ssc">British</a> and the German forces during the First <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0cm2xh">World War (1914-1918</a>). The Battle of Delville Wood continued from 14 July to 3 September, was an engagement in the 1916 <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0gjw_">Battle of the Somme</a>. The Wood was captured by the South African Infantry Brigade on 15 July 1916 and was held until 19 July at a very high cost on casualties as the wood formed a salient and was bombed by the German forces from three sided. The thick wood was nearly demolished by the bombings and in 1926, 10 years later, when Everard visited the site it was still only crates and stumps. Everard donated the painting after the Everard Group exhibited at the MacFadyen Memorial Hall on 19 October 1935. Short biography: Bertha (King) Everard was born in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m01tjvv">Durban</a>, South Africa in 1873. Everard was initially trained as a pianist in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0fhp9">Vienna</a> but later studied painting between 1893 and 1899 at various schools in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m02jx1">England</a>, including the Slade and Westminster art schools in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m04jpl">London</a> and the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m013p1n">St Ives</a> School of Landscape in Cornwall. In 1902, Everard began teaching at the Staats Model School in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a> but after marrying Charles Everard in 1903, she moved with him to Bonnefoi, a small trading post on the Eastern Transvaal escarpment near Carolina. In 1910, Everard won a gold <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m020yd1">medal</a> at the South African National Union art exhibition in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0g284">Johannesburg</a>, organised by Florence Phillips, with a landscape painting in oils. Everard accompanied her two daughters Ruth and Rosamund to be educated in Europe in the 1920s and lived between England and <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m05qtj">Paris</a>, exhibiting at the Royal Academy in London in 1923 and on the Paris Salon in 1924 and 1926. Everard returned to South Africa to live on the farm in 1926, painting mostly landscapes and exclusively in oils. Her work was shown at the Empire Exhibition in Johannesburg in 1936 and, in 1967, the Pretoria Art Museum held a prestige retrospective exhibition of the work of ï¿½The Everard Groupï¿½ ­ï¿½ Bertha Everard, her daughters Ruth and Rosamund, and her sister Edith King.',

In 1896, Van Wouw was commissioned to do stucco work for the Standard Bank Building on Church Square in Pretoria. He created these works first in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m01w_gm">plaster</a> and then cast them into cement. In 1955, the Standard Bank Building was demolished and this plaster of Paris work from the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m03nfmq">architectural</a> detail of the building is one of the few remaining works as a reminder of Van Wouw''s early in his career in South Africa. The plaster of Paris architectural scroll derived from Van Wouw Estate as it was found stored at a foundry after the artist''s death in 1945. The University of Pretoria acquired this work in 1978. Short biography: Anton van Wouw was born on 26 December 1862 in Driebergen in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m059j2">the Netherlands</a>. After school, Van Wouw began as a stucco worker in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m029t1">Delft</a> where he learnt the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06msq">art of sculpture</a>. He studied at the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06hdk">Rotterdam</a> Academy for Arts, but stopped his studies to join his father and brother in South Africa. After having a hard time as an artist in the early beginnings of his career of the then Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek (South African Republic 1852-1902) Van Wouw was finally recognised for his work when Sammy Marks (1884-1920), a Lithuanian-born South African industrialist and financier, commissioned Van Wouw to create the famous Kruger Memorial, currently situated on Church Square in the centre of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0hzlz">South Africa''s</a> Capital city Pretoria. From there, Van Wouw art went from strength to strength creating over ten large bronze monuments, as well as more than 100 other sculptures in his lifetime. Anton van Wouw passed away in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a> in 1945 just after completing his largest work, a figure of Woman and Children for the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m02cnny">Voortrekker Monument</a> in Pretoria.',

The following statement was made about her works at the exhibition: "Zyma Amien has a generation link to the garment and textile industry, hence her focus on this industry. The nature of manufacture and production asks of the worker to remain in one position and at one station for the entire working day. The days lead to weeks, months and years. The workers continue to do repetitive work for their entire working life. This repetitive and alienation became the point of departure when creating the work. Amien created print using techniques like woodcutting, etching, marking making on copper plates, monoprints and lino cuts. These techniques require the artist to work alone and focusing only on the work and performing repetitive actions. Paraphernalia of the garment and textile industry such as pins, dress patterns and cotton <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0641k">paper</a> was used specifically as a reference. Amien uses her role as an artist in society to highlight the plight of the garment workers, but is thoroughly aware that art cannot fix anything".

As a child, Pudi lived a life of poverty, but often watched when his maternal grandfather, David Motladi, a carpenter, was at work. In order to survive, Pudi herded goats for relatives and thus only started school at age 11. Frustrated by his academic deficit, he soon dropped out, joined a local gang and became a street fighter. A forced removal relocated Pudiï¿½s family to Ga-Rankuwa Township outside Pretoria, and the separation from his gangster friends had a positive consequence, as at age 15 he met a teacher who encouraged him to take up <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m083vt">wood</a> carving. He went back to school at age 21, but again became despondent and dropped out. At that point Pudi sought out the company of other artists for advice. He met Motshile Nthodi, an artist who had contact with the Schweickerdt Arts Gallery in Pretoria. Nthodi was impressed by Pudiï¿½s work and helped him to stage his first one man exhibition, which launched his career as artist. Pudiï¿½s works are classified as African expressionistic, his forms are distorted and exaggerated. His wood carvings depict humans in their most abstract forms. He rejects the forms and conformity of naturalism, yet aim to evoke personal emotions. His works are reflections of his upbringing. His naivety to financial security motivates the style and appearance of his works. One of the most prominent figures in his works is the black male figure in his environment.',

Inspired by a teacher in preparatory school, Mmango pursued art through high school, delving into different mediums but primarily sticking to pencil and charcoal.

Nzuza completed a MA(Hons) Government, Policy and Society at the University of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m02m77">Edinburgh</a> in 2022, after which he continued to resume his practice as a self-taught artist. Known for his cubism-influenced and rich texture-filled artworks, which tell a story that resonates with battling loneliness and navigating the self. His works are inspired by his own personal history and popular culture. The idea of stagnation and mental health development is a recurring theme in his work and for him, the forming of his figures is a means of uncovering an individualï¿½s character. This is a core focus of his practice and his oil paintings flourished mainly since the 2020 <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/g11fr15t15h">Covid-19 pandemic</a>. Growing up in a rigid and conservative environment, Nzuza used art as an outlet to portray the complexity and optimism of his experience, an extension of his past, the present, and the future. Art serves as a personal quest in an attempt to materialize his experience and for others, on their displacement through the use of colour symbolism, often using neutral colours. Using a distinctive technique that involves creating disjointed lines and colours, exploring the unexpected harmony in the imbalance and imperfections. In turn, creating unique compositions that simultaneously reflect his life. Nzuza continues to work as a self-taught visual artist and lives in Durban.',

In this work, water is depicted three-dimensionally as sustenance and life-giving element in the ï¿½fluidï¿½ medium of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m039jq">glass</a>. The materiality of the medium of glass was also used as a means to visually resemble water within the work. The inherent properties of the medium, its transparency and fragility, allow an ironic undertone: a whaleï¿½s skeleton is revealed below when the light that plays on the surface penetrates the glass. Water courses in a constant cycle of life and death. The initial idea from the architects of the Aula Building where Te Water Gelaat is situated, was for a water feature to be in the space. However, the University of Pretoria felt that with water being a scarcity in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0dg3n1">Africa</a>, it would not be socially responsible to use water for aesthetic purposes. Te Water gelaat was installed into its permanent space by the artist in 2013.

    'A mixed media sculpture by the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0hzlz">South African</a> artist Mellaney Roberts (b.1988). The statement by the artist that accompanied the work is as follows: "In South Africa, the term ï¿½Colouredï¿½ defines a community as racially mixed and describes a hybrid community. The ambiguous nature of the Coloured identity, coupled with the absence of recorded histories and unambiguous identification with collective cultural codes, results in the representation of identity becoming challenged and borderline. This hybrid identity makes it difficult to reflect on a specific culture and social circumstances. When trying to imagine yourself differently, perceptions of identity and community become more difficult to pin down. This process can become painful. As a Coloured, in the collective memory of my story, I always felt like an invisible individual trapped between Black and White classifications. Therein lies an untold story of being somewhere between and not represented, creating the feeling of ï¿½not-belongingï¿½. Through constructing narratives of lived experience, hybrid communities can challenge dominant stereotypes and subvert discourses of otherness and difference. My body of work focuses on presenting ceramic sculptures depicting the fluid shift of borders. I use borders as a metaphor for the way that our identity transforms as we experience various spaces. My ceramic <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06msq">sculptural</a> forms are often cut, pierced, or demarcated showing the divisions in cultural differences. The divisions emphasise how the parameters of identity are often blurred and how an objectï¿½s placement in space can reference things other than itself, acting as a memory trigger. My intuitive response to <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0975t">clay</a> enlists the rich and multileveled reference that <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m01x5q">ceramics</a> has as a medium, evoking the permanence and impermanence associated with time."',

The series comments on the artist''s spiritual journey through the transmutation ceremonies of the San people, Christianity as well as his personal journey through living in the veld to being integrated to modern society. Short Biography: Vetkat Kruiper Regopstaan Boesman (mostly referred to as Vetkat Kruiper) was born in 1969 in Twee Rivieren and was a member of the Khomani San tribe in what is today known as the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park region. His father was a healer and crafter in his community, and clearly had a huge impact on Vetkatï¿½s art knowledge and understanding of San culture and customs. vetkat is one of very few San artists who sustained the ï¿½lostï¿½ (according to some) tradition of San rock art, but with ink on <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0641k">paper</a> as medium. The animality, spirituality and symbolism in Vetkatï¿½s works has been the topic of several academic studies. Vetkatï¿½s works are in private collections at the Natal Museum Services, the McGregor Museum at <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m01tjpx">Kimberley</a> and at the University of Pretoria. From 2002 to 2005, his art was displayed at the United Nations (UN) as part of an exhibition of indigenous art, while his 2004 tour of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m09c7w0">the United States of America</a> culminated in his addressing the UN. Shortly before his death in 2007, Vetkat was invited by the Department of Built Environment at the University of Pretoria to do a solo exhibition on the University of Pretoria campus. All the works on exhibit were purchased by the University of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a>, and constitutes the largest assemblage of the artistï¿½s works in a single collection, now curated by the University of Pretoria Museums.',

He learnt art through reading books and met his fellow artists through reading the book, Contemporary <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0dg3n1">African</a> Art in South Africa (1971) by EJ de Jager and as a result Malemane began experimenting with woodcuts. In the late 1970s, he was moved to the Department of Fine Arts where he was further inspired by the Rorkeï¿½s Drift Art School  in Natal considered one of the most prolific art schools for black artists during Apartheid. Malemaneï¿½s work is about the immortalisation of tribal traditions, something he realized would soon disappear in a modern society. This Malemane''s etchings were donated to the University of Pretoria by Carla Wasserthal. The collection belonged to her husband, Klaus Wasserthal (1927-2012) who collected African arts during the many exhibitions he held at his candle-making gallery in Pretoria.

Mayer travelled South Africa extensively  and used his popular representative style to capture the lives of ordinary rural <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0hzlz">South Africans</a> and their environments on canvas. The Blaauwberg is an iconic blue haze mountain range adjacent to the Soutpansberg <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m09d_r">mountains</a> that stretches nearly 900 km in the Limpopo Province of South Africa and apparently this watercolour depicts some of the San paintings he came across in his travels.

Mayer came to South Africa in 1898 to work as a land surveyor in the Free State and later imigrated north to the Transvaal. Just over a year after coming to the Transvaal, the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0bqtx">South African War</a> (1899-1902) broke out and he was called to arms to join on the Boer side, he was captured and sent to St. Helena Island as a Prisoner of War.  After the war, he commenced his career as an artist, mostly painting small watercolour works. He settled in Pretoria and would often go out into the countryside on painting trips with his friend J F <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m043cgm">Pierneef</a>, who also taught Mayer the art of woodcut printing.  In the First <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0cm2xh">World War (1914-1918</a>), as well as the Second World War (1939-1945) Mayer was intered yet again in prisoner of war camps due to his German descent.

Mabaso was involved with printmaking for over three decades in South Africa and established The Sguzu Printmakers Workshop in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0g284">Johannesburg</a>. Mabaso''s father, a commercial printer, introduced his son to the world of printing presses, <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0641k">paper</a> and ink at a young age. Mabaso took a turn away from the commercial world of printing and began exploring the possibilities of original prints during his time studying at Rorke''s Drift where he studied  in 1975. Mabasoï¿½s drawings, prints and paintings are translations of his subjective experience  and observations of his life, whereabouts, music, politics and power. His work is humanistic, individualized and soulfully in love with South Africa and her people.Mabaso passed away after a long illness in September 2013 at age 58.',

In the late 1970s he was moved to the Department of Fine Arts where he was further inspired by the Rorkeï¿½s Drift Art School artists (The art school is in Natal and one of the most prolific art schools for black artists during Apartheid).

In my artworks I use water and clouds as a metaphor to portray the feeling of anxiety and dislocation." In the series of vases ï¿½Back and forthï¿½  she utilised handmade earthenware vases covered in multiple pictorial narratives to underscore the fact that one creates and fashions our own "person hoods". The various fragments of the tangled identity are formed through layers of brushstrokes that create disjointed, multidimensional collage images. While, Greyling uses personal family photographs, none of the people are recognizable, which enables the viewer to connect with the artworks. Yet, even though the public is invited to participate in the artwork, these series of images and objects remain a deeply personal reflection and cathartic exploration of the artists own complicated and confused sense of being South African.',

The work depicts Hunters hunting a <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m096mb">Lion</a> close to the village. Short Biography: Born in 1950, Makapanstad, Pretoria. As a child, Pudi lived a life of poverty, but often watched when his maternal grandfather, David Motladi, a carpenter, was at work. In order to survive, Pudi herded goats for relatives and thus only started school at age 11. Frustrated by his academic deficit, he soon dropped out, joined a local gang and became a street fighter. A forced removal relocated Pudiï¿½s family to Ga-Rankuwa Township outside <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a>, and the separation from his gangster friends had a positive consequence, as at age 15 he met a teacher who encouraged him to take up <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m083vt">wood</a> carving. He went back to school at age 21, but again became despondent and dropped out. At that point Pudi sought out the company of other artists for advice. He met Motshile Nthodi, an artist who had contact with the Schweickerdt Arts Gallery in Pretoria. Nthodi was impressed by Pudiï¿½s work and helped him to stage his first one man exhibition, which launched his career as artist. Pudiï¿½s works are classified as African expressionistic, his forms are distorted and exaggerated. His wood carvings depict humans in their most abstract forms. He rejects the forms and conformity of naturalism, yet aim to evoke personal emotions. His works are reflections of his upbringing. His naivety to financial security motivates the style and appearance of his works. One of the most prominent figures in his works is the black male figure in his environment.',

This bronze relief panel is a maquette for one of the panels in the station. Short biography: Anton van Wouw was born on 26 December 1862 in Driebergen in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m059j2">the Netherlands</a>. After school, Van Wouw began as a stucco worker in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m029t1">Delft</a> where he learnt the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06msq">art of sculpture</a>.

Prof Eduard (Eddie) Muntingh Hamman (1912-1987) was the seventh Principal of the University of Pretoria and his tenure stretched between 1970 and 1981. The official commission of key portraits and hence, the foundation of what is referred to as the portrait collection within the University of Pretoria, began on 9 September 1974. Prof AN Pelzer (Vice-Rector) suggested that the university commence a commission of key portraits of former Chancellors, <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m01mzpv">Chairs</a> of the Council and Principals or Rectors. Short Biography: Irmin Henkel was born in Renburg, <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m03pbf">Hanover</a> in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0345h">Germany</a> during 1921 and he became a resident of South Africa in 1951. He was a self-taught artist who mostly specialized in still life and portraits. Art was however not his first occupation, Henkel was a fully qualified orthopaedic surgeon who worked at the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a> Provincial Hospital (today Steve Biko Hospital). During the Second World War he served as a doctor in the German military, practising orthopaedic surgery. Henkel achieved rapid prominence as a portraitist in South Africa, and his skills made him the almost automatic choice for official government commissions. He possessed an engaging insouciant manner and sense of humour, which relaxed the sitter and enabled the artist to observe his characteristic disposition and expressions. His portraits were usually effective likenesses of the subject, but they fluctuate markedly in artistic quality. Henkelï¿½s handling of subject matter other than portraits was relaxed and colourful; his style in all was usually loosely naturalistic as was his many works with <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0c9ph5">flowers</a> and still life subjects.',

    'Made in South Africa II is a pastel drawing by the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0hzlz">South African</a> artist David Koloane (1938-2019). The drawing shows a burning township. The work was done in a time of turmoil in South Africa. The first democratic elections were about to take place in the country, but there were tensions between the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) and the African National Congress (ANC). On 29 March 1994, the IFP marched to Shell House, the headquarters of the ANC. ANC guards opened fire on the protesters, killing 19 people. Known today as the Shell House massacre. This sparked battles between the two political parties, as many of their supporters lived in the same neighbourhoods. Short Biography: <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0gx02sn">David Nthubu Koloane</a> was born in 1938 in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0459hh">Alexandra</a>, Johannesburg. He studied under Bill Ainsley and later graduated with a Diploma in Museum Studies at the University of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m04jpl">London</a>. The artist also co-founded the Bag Factory Artistsï¿½ Studio with <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/g113r34hl5">Sam Nhlengethwa</a> in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0g284">Johannesburg</a> in 1991. The main aim of the Bag Factory Artistsï¿½ Studio is to provide studio space to black artists who have little access to artistic resources. The Bag Factory Artistsï¿½ Studio is still active today.

    'Jan Jacob Spohler',
    '1849',
    'The painting is oil on Canvas by the Dutch artist Jan Jacob Spohler (1811-1879) titled The Swan or Her Zwaantjie. The painting is a landscape with a building on the right side of a road, a small ship to the left and a large area of sky dominating the top half. The top half of the painting consists of a cloudy sky with a dark cloud in the top right hand corner and a split in the clouds in the center. ï¿½Het Zwaantjieï¿½ is an inn that is conjured up by the artistï¿½s imagination and not necessarily a real place. The painting is rich with symbolism that include a ghostly/angel-like figure/apparition at the entrance of the inn to the left of the door against the wall, the swan on the advertisement Board, the knotted bale of hay on the roof of the storage area and the black flag hanging from the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m019jd">boat</a>, all of which are symbols for death or bereavement. The Swan, which is the name of the inn and also the title of the work, is commonly seen as the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m015p6">bird</a> that will take your soul on to the next world. The inn is also seen as a temporary dwelling, making the inn an allegory for the place in-between life and the afterlife, therefore there is no bridge connecting the inn with the town. The boat is probably a play on the Roman boat taking someone to the afterlife over the river Styx mixed with the Catholic Purgatory. The signpost next to the road probably shows a particular moment in life with a traveler moving from the inn on the afterlife. The symbols above therefore denote that the painting is an allegory for someoneï¿½s death. In the background is the St. Dionysius church located in the town of Tilburg and built in 1826. This gives us a possible place where the death occurred. On the left side of the painting one can notice an orange white and blue flag at the back of the boat, which resembles the national flag of the Netherlands. This may provide a clue as to the death of a certain individual: Putting these three elements of death, the church of Tilburg and the Dutch national flag together allows for the assumption that the painting is about the death of King <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0znyz">Willem II of the Netherlands</a>, best known for his lead of the vanguard of the battle of Waterloo, suddenly died at the age of 57 in 1849 in the town of Tilburg in the province of Noord Brabant in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m059j2">the Netherlands</a>. An interesting thing to notice is that everyone is dressed about the same which makes the point that in death king or laymen are all equal, a reference to the Dance Macabre.',

    'A tracing of the Portrait of Dante by Seymour Kirkup (1788-1880) from the painting originally done by Giotto. In the last 150 years many articles and books have been written on the artwork representing Dante Alighieri (1265-1321) by the famous early Renaissance painter, <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0kp91">Giotto di Bondone</a> (1266-1337). Many things have been said about the painting and there is much doubt whether it was actually executed by Giotto. The portrait of Dante was painted between 1290 and 1336. The painting, part of a fresco, was executed in the chapel of the Palace of the Podestï¿½ in Florence. During the sixteenth or seventeenth century the once elaborate paintings in the chapel were covered with whitewash and the chapel was converted into a storeroom for the prison that the palace became. Here the Dante portrait by the hand of Giotto was to lay hidden for many years. The rediscovery and restoration of the Dante portrait by Giotto tells a very interesting story. In the early to middle nineteenth century, three scholars, devoted to the works of Dante, started a search for the long lost painting which had been mentioned and described by <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m01596r">Lorenzo Ghiberti</a> (1379-1455) in his Commentarii. The three 19th century scholars were Richard Henry Wilde (1789-1847), an American, Seymour Stocker Kirkup (1788-1880), an Englishman and an Italian, Giovanni Aubrey Bezzi. After much deliberation with the Italian Government, a Florentine painter, Antonio Marini (1788-1861), was entrusted with the removal of the whitewash from the chapel walls. After a couple of months, the long lost portrait of Dante was rediscovered on 21 July 1840. Kirkup in a letter to the Spectator (London) on 11 May 1850 explained that for a long time he had been prevented from making a drawing of the portrait in the chapel. Eventually in 1841 he obtained permission to be shut up in the prison for a morning, and in this time he made a drawing and a tracing of the work. A facsimile of Kirkupï¿½s drawing was passed on to George James Warren Lord Vernon the 5th (1803-1866) and it was published by the Arundel Society in 1859 as a chromo-lithograph. Kirkup gave his tracing, this <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m063w2">pencil</a> sketch, to his friend Gabriel Rossetti, who in turn gave it to his son, the famous English Pre-Raphaelite painter, Dante Gabriel Rossetti (1828-1882). This tracing was sold in 1882 after <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m03xpqgs">Dante Gabriel Rossetti</a>ï¿½s death. In 1940 the work was sold at auction in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m04jpl">London</a> and bought by the Dutch art collector Jacob van Tilburg (1888-1980). In 1976 he bequeathed the largest part of his collection to the University of Pretoria.',

As early as 1902, Van Wouw created in-depth studies of black people, particularly those that were under his employment at the time. In 1937, Van Wouw created a small series of works such as, The Thinker,  and the Laughing Basotho for which he used the same model. Short biography: <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m09n5cb">Anton van Wouw</a> was born on 26 December 1862 in Driebergen in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m059j2">the Netherlands</a>.

He studied at the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06hdk">Rotterdam</a> Academy for Arts, but stopped his studies to join his father and brother in South Africa. After having a hard time as an artist in the early beginnings of his career of the then Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek (South African Republic 1852-1902) Van Wouw was finally recognised for his work when Sammy Marks (1884-1920), a Lithuanian-born South African industrialist and financier, commissioned Van Wouw to create the famous Kruger Memorial, currently situated on Church Square in the centre of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0hzlz">South Africa''s</a> Capital city Pretoria. From there, Van Wouw''s art went from strength to strength creating over 10 large bronze monuments, as well as more than 100 other sculptures in his lifetime.

    'Bridesmaid by the South African artist Christo Coetzee (1929-2000). Bridesmaid is probably one of Coetzeeï¿½s earliest works with the theme that he would continue to use for another forty five years, and is classified as one of his key genre-paintings. This artwork particularly reminds one of the European romantic painters of the early 1900s. In an interview done in 1981, Coetzee ascribed his love of the theme of brides and bridesmaids to, what he called, his earliest memory, being a <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m09l0j_">ring</a>-bearer at a cousin''s <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m081hv">wedding ceremony</a>. Several of Coetzee''s works of the bride theme are well-known. Short biography. The Johannesburg born artist, Christo Coetzee pursued his art studies at the Slade School of Art in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m04jpl">London</a> as a complementary tuition exercise to his fine art degree qualification acquired from the University of the Witwatersrand in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0g284">Johannesburg</a> South Africa.

Later, Coetzee went to <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m03_3d">Japan</a> where he was invited to join the Gutai Group, the first radical Art Group in post-war Japan. It was in Japan that Coetzee developed his later art style that ultimately classified him as <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0hzlz">South Africa''s</a> leading and prominent avant-garde artists. Coetzee received international recognition for his contribution to the avant-garde art movements known as Art Informel, Assemblage and Neo-Baroque in Paris, Spain and Japan during the 1950s and 1960s, an art style he perfected.

Because the road was to narrow we could not get out of the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0k4j">car</a>. My window (I sat at the back) could not open. I therefore took the photograph through the drops. I then gave the camera to Abrie, in front, to photograph the rainbow through his open window. Afterwards we saw that the rainbow was in front of the hills. To put the work into context, the Hell is a small town also known as Gamkaskloof in the Eastern Cape Province.

    'A mixed media graphic work by the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0hzlz">South African</a> artist Zyma Amien (1980) titled Modus Operandi. The work was exhibited at the Correlative Conjunctions exhibition in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a> in 2018. The following statement was made about her works at the exhibition: "Zyma Amien has a generation link to the garment and textile industry, hence her focus on this industry. The nature of manufacture and production asks of the worker to remain in one position and at one station for the entire working day. The days lead to weeks, months and years. The workers continue to do repetitive work for their entire working life. This repetitive and alienation became the point of departure when creating the work. Amien created print using techniques like woodcutting, etching, marking making on copper plates, monoprints and lino cuts. These techniques require the artist to work alone and focusing only on the work and performing repetitive actions. Paraphernalia of the garment and textile industry such as pins, dress patterns and cotton <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0641k">paper</a> was used specifically as a reference. Amien uses her role as an artist in society to highlight the plight of the garment workers, but is thoroughly aware that art cannot fix anything". Short Biography: Zyma Amien was born in Lansdowne in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m01yj2">Cape Town</a>. She completed her Masters in Fine Arts at the University of Cape Town in 2015.',

Erich Mayer was awarded a <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m020yd1">Medal</a> of Honour for painting by the South African Academy  in 1943. Mayer''s works are highly sought after as his paintings depict a fairly comprehensive record of rural South African life and scenery during the first half of the 20th Century.  Mayer''s works are iconic of South African art as throughout his artistic career he adopted such an intense South African character. Erich Mayer died in Pretoria in 1960.',

Michel Tapiï¿½ (1909-1987) was a <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0f8l9c">French</a> art connoisseur, collector, critic and curator. He was very influential during the 1940s and 1950s during the French art movement known as Abstract Lyrique or Tachisme(derived from the French word, tache meaning stain) which is a form of Abstract Expressionism or a non-geometric abstract painting. The term tachisme was first used to describe this movement in 1951, by French critics Charles Estienne and Pierre Guï¿½guen, and was then popularised more widely by French critic and painter Michel Tapiï¿½ in his 1952 publication Un Art autre. However, the term had already been used in 1889 by <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0cs60y">Felix Feneon</a> to describe impressionist painting, and again in 1909 by designer and theorist <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m058q3r">Maurice Denis</a> to refer to the Fauvism movement of French painting. Michael Tapiï¿½ opened <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m03qr476">Christo</a>ï¿½s exhibition at the Stadler Gallery in 1961 and wrote about his work as " the actual answer to all those who reproach Europe for being unadventurous in experimentingï¿½. Short biography. The Johannesburg born artist, Christo Coetzee pursued his art studies at the Slade School of Art in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m04jpl">London</a> as a complementary tuition exercise to his fine art degree qualification acquired from the University of the Witwatersrand in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0g284">Johannesburg</a> South Africa. Most of Coetzee''s works are mainly colourful, stylized figurative images and still lifes. After completing his studies he moved to Europe on an Government Travelling Scholarship  and become part of the Stadler Stable in Paris before moving to Finestrat in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m06mkj">Spain</a>. Later, Coetzee went to <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m03_3d">Japan</a> where he was invited to join the Gutai Group, the first radical Art Group in post-war Japan. It was in Japan that Coetzee developed his later art style that ultimately classified him as <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0hzlz">South Africa''s</a> leading and prominent avant-garde artists. Coetzee received international recognition for his contribution to the avant-garde art movements known as Art Informel, Assemblage and Neo-Baroque in Paris, Spain and Japan during the 1950s and 1960s, an art style he perfected. He passed away at the age of 71 in 2000 in Tulbagh in the Cape and bequeathed his entire home and collection to the University of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m067z4">Pretoria</a>.',

The vessel exterior is executed with <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m037vk">graphite</a> silver decoration in bands and geometric triangular forms as well as the inner rim is also finely decorated. Such traditional Venda pots are usually domestic and functional decorated with iron oxide powder and graphite over a terracotta clay body.  Production of Venda <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m01x5q">ceramics</a> can date back centuries as the skills are handed down from generation to generation. These vessels are shaped by hand from raw clay obtained from local river banks, made to form the round body and then low fired in an open pit and then left to dy for several days. Signature Venda ceramics are typically decorated with ochre pigment and graphite burnished onto the exterior surface for decoration, resulting in a smooth, high gloss undulated surface. The selection of clay, production of <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m064rk">pottery</a> and firing of pots remains an active cultural traditional among Venda women. Often the vessels are stained with red ochre soil known in the TshiVenda language as, "luvhundi" .

Coetzee painted Anubis, the Egyptian god of the afterlife, which is considered to be an example of one of his Hermetic works which is characterised by the use of mythological creatures, figures and symbols. As an avid reader and lover of books, Coetzee found inspiration in his books of his vast library for many of these creations. Saint Christopher is a saint venerated by Roman Catholics and Orthodox Christians, listed as a martyr killed in the reign of the 3rd century Roman emperor Decius (reigned 249ï¿½251). In Eastern Iconography he is sometimes represented with a dog face. Ouija mentioned in an inscription on in the painting (spelled Oudja) is the eye of Horus (originally the eye of Ra) and symbolises power, interestingly enough the eye eats power and in this case Anubis eats the eye. The condition of cynocephali, having the head of a dog ï¿½ or of a jackalï¿½ is a widely attested legendary phenomenon existing in many different forms and contexts.  Short biography. The Johannesburg born artist, Christo Coetzee pursued his art studies at the Slade School of Art in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m04jpl">London</a> as a complementary tuition exercise to his fine art degree qualification acquired from the University of the Witwatersrand in <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m0g284">Johannesburg</a> South Africa.
